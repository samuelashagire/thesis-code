*GROSS:	same money for the purchase of the advertising . 72409_75440
*GROSS:	Respondent Scientific-Atlanta created a document falsely claiming
	that the reason for the increased payments from Charter were because
	of increased manufacturing expenses . 75440_88715
*KENN:	The transaction was not wholly without benefit to
	Scientific-Atlanta . 88715_94478
*KENN:	They got some advertising . 94478_95712
*KENN:	And it was not wholly without benefit to Charter . 95712_98805
*KENN:	They were able to show that advertising works . 98805_102085
*KENN:	Now , that puts aside the fact that they were using misleading
	accounting principles . 102085_107957
*GROSS:	Well , I would agree , Your Honor , that they received free
	advertising . 107957_112878
*GROSS:	But the problem was that they were creating the illusion that it
	wasn't free advertising , but rather that they were purchasing the
	advertising . 112878_121610
*GINS:	And was the price four to five times higher than the normal rates
	for advertising ? 121610_126998
*GROSS:	That is correct , Justice Ginsburg . 126998_128779
*GROSS:	And the obvious purpose for creating the illusion that they were
	purchasing the advertising rather than receiving free advertising
	was so that Charter can incorporate these increased revenues in
	their financial statements . 128779_144522
*GROSS:	And Respondents understood , +/. 144522_147083
@G:	---
*GROSS:	they understood that in order to (.) for Charter to pass this by

	reflected in the indictment (.) in order to deceive the accountants
	for Charter , the Respondents were told that there had to be
	separate agreements for both the advertising agreements and the
	purchase agreements . 147083_170715
*SCAL:	<Mister> [= Mr.] Grossman , is there any reason why , in principle
	, the elements for a cause of action under <ten b@l five> [= 10b-5]
	have to be the same as the elements for a cause of action by the
	agency under <ten b@l> [= 10(b)] ? 170715_189754
*SCAL:	I mean , we , we created this , this cause of action . 189754_196235
*SCAL:	It's not set forth in the statute , although other private causes
	of action are . 196235_201421
*SCAL:	If it's our creation , couldn't we sensibly limit it so that , for
	example , schemes can be attacked by the <S_E_C> [= SEC] , but
	schemes do not form the basis for private attorney general's actions
	? 201421_223631
*SCAL:	You need actual conveyance of a misrepresentation to the injured
	party . 223631_233704
*SCAL:	Is there any reason why we couldn't do that ? 233704_235282
*GROSS:	Well , I think there are two reasons , Your Honor . 235282_237734
*GROSS:	The first is that at this point in time (.) I think as the Court
	recognized in Dura fairly recently (.) that when Congress enacted
	the Private Security Law Reform Act , that at that time they
	accepted +/. 237734_256118
@G:	---
*GROSS:	the private right of action that this Court had previously inferred
	. 256118_259678
*GROSS:	And this Court had previously inferred the private right of action
	not only for the section but each of the rules in Section <ten b@l>
	[= 10(b)] . 259678_269018
*ROBE:	But it's not like under the Sherman Act , where we have reason to
	think Congress intended the Court to go about the business of
	construing and developing antitrust law . 269018_277156
*ROBE:	In fact , they have kind of taken over for us . 277156_279187
*ROBE:	They are imposing certain limits on when actions can be brought ,
	proposing particular specific elements . 279187_284716
*ROBE:	In one of the provisions , <twenty e@l> [= 20(e)] , specifying the
	<S_E_C> [= SEC] can bring an action but private investors can't . 284716_291479
*ROBE:	I mean , we don't get in this business of implying private rights
	of action any more . 291479_295976
*ROBE:	And isn't the effort by Congress to legislate a good signal that
	they have kind of picked up the ball and they are running with it
	and we shouldn't ? 295976_303925
*GROSS:	Well , this Court , Your Honor , as recently as <twenty oh two>
	[= 2002] in Wharf <Holdings> [= (Holdings)] said there is a private
	right of action for violation of any of the subdivisions of rule
	<ten b@l five> [= 10b-5] : a , b , or c . 303925_318749
*GROSS:	That would have to be reversed . 318749_320342

*ROBE:	Well , that's kind of my point . 334554_335757
*ROBE:	We did that sort of thing in <nineteen seventy-one> [= 1971] . 335757_338725
*ROBE:	We haven't done it for quite sometime . 338725_340567
*GROSS:	+, But when Congress enacted the Private Security Law Reform Act ,
	everything it did in connection with that statute was directed to
	the private right of action that this Court had previously implied
	under <ten b@l> [= 10(b)] . 340567_352844
*GROSS:	Nothing that Congress did was intended in any way +/. 352844_358701
*ROBE:	I'm not (.) my suggestion is not that we should go back and say
	that there is no private right of action . 358701_362685
*ROBE:	My suggestion is that we should get out of the business of
	expanding it , because Congress has taken over and is legislating in
	the area in a way they weren't back when we implied the right of
	action under <ten b@l> [= 10(b)] . 362685_373976
*GROSS:	+, Well , I would agree , Congress has taken it over . 373976_376928
*GROSS:	And when they enacted the Private Security Law Reform Act , they
	recognized this private right of action . 376928_382849
*GROSS:	Everything they did recognized the private right of action . 382849_387018
*GROSS:	It recognized that there would be multiple primary violators of

*GROSS:	provisions . 396703_396937
*GROSS:	It recognized that there would be multiple players . 396937_399888
*GROSS:	So certainly , Congress had an understanding of what this Court had
	done up until that time . 399888_404964
*GROSS:	And this Court up until that time had implied the private right of
	action for every subset of rule <ten b@l five> [= 10b-5] . 404964_411634
*ROBE:	Is it (.) is it a necessary part of your theory that the deceptive
	practice that Scientific-Atlanta went in , that they knew that that
	was also (.) that Charter would carry that forward ? 411634_423410
*ROBE:	I mean , let's suppose that there were benefits to this deceptive
	practice to Scientific-Atlanta , that it looked like it had more
	money to spend on advertising than it really did , but they didn't
	care what Charter did with it . 423410_434578
*ROBE:	In fact , they didn't know that Charter was going to carry it on
	its books the way they did . 434578_438124
*ROBE:	Would there still be liability for Scientific-Atlanta ? 438124_442123
*GROSS:	No . 442123_442623
*GROSS:	No , not under the test that we have proposed , which is very
	similar to the test proposed by the Ninth Circuit or applied in the
	Ninth Circuit in the Simpson case , and the test proposed by the
	Securities and Exchange Commission in their amicus brief submitted
	in the Simpson case . 442623_459365
*GROSS:	It's not enough to just to have the deceptive act . 459365_462895
*GROSS:	The deceptive act for scheme liability has to be with the purpose
	of +/. 462895_467800
@G:	---
*GROSS:	furthering a scheme to defraud investors . 467800_470767
*GROSS:	So if Scientific-Atlanta or Motorola had engaged in deceptive
	conduct , but that deceptive conduct was not intended to further a
	scheme to defraud the shareholders , no , Your Honor , there would
	be no action under the theory that we are pursuing here . 470767_486574
*SCAL:	Intended or known ? 486574_489995
*SCAL:	I mean , I don't see (.) what's in it for Scientific-Atlanta to
	defraud the shareholders ? 489995_498288
*SCAL:	Is it enough that they just knew it would be used for that purpose
	? 498288_502083
*GROSS:	Oh , it would be enough if they committed a deceptive act and they
	knew it was in furtherance of a scheme . 502083_510783
*SCAL:	Well , when you say “in furtherance of” , you (.) you import intent
	. 510783_516655
*SCAL:	They didn't care what Charter was going to do with it , but they
	pretty well knew that what Charter was going to do was to make its
	books look better . 516655_526043
*SCAL:	Would that be enough ? 526043_527479
*GROSS:	I think that would be reckless . 527479_528791
*SCAL:	That's what I thought your position was . 528791_530650
*GROSS:	Yes , but my position is also +/. 530650_531806
*SCAL:	So it's not an intent necessarily . 531806_533946
*SCAL:	It's just knowledge . 533946_535430
*GROSS:	+, It certainly needs scienter . 535430_536960
*GROSS:	You certainly need scienter . 536960_539365
*SOUT:	I mean , it's more than knowledge . 539364_540974
*SOUT:	I mean , you mentioned recklessness . 540974_542581
*SOUT:	It's got to have either knowledge of or a willingness to maintain
	an indifference to the consequence . 542581_550267
*GROSS:	Exactly right , Justice Souter . 550267_551859
*GROSS:	And I think it's important (.) and there is a very (.) there is a
	very good discussion of this in the Simpson case by the Ninth
	Circuit , that the purpose of the test is such that it will not
	ensnare someone who does engage in a deceptive act but doesn't
	understand that the reason for it is to further a scheme . 551859_573102
*SCAL:	Sure . 573102_573430
*SCAL:	After trial (.) you know , after trial which causes your stock to
	tank , you may indeed be able to show that you didn't know it was
	going to be used for that purpose . 573430_584971
*SCAL:	I mean , that's what this is all about , isn't it , getting it (.)
	getting it by the summary-judgment stage ? 584971_590328
*GROSS:	No . 590328_590828
*GROSS:	I think , Your Honor , that this Court answered this last term in
	the Tellabs case . 590828_595310

*GROSS:	+, Well , of course if you just (.) if you just allege it on

*GROSS:	No doubt about that . 650773_652132
*GROSS:	That doesn't pass the heightened pleading standard in Tellabs or

*GROSS:	What you do need is what we have here . 655193_657178
*GROSS:	Here you have allegations (.) and we didn't make these allegations
	from whole cloth (.) these allegations were derived principally from
	a grand jury (.) the Federal grand jury indictment against Charter
	executives . 657178_669720

	678372_682432
*ROBE:	There we said there's no aiding-and-abetting liability , Congress

*ROBE:	Why shouldn't that inform how we further develop the private action

*GROSS:	They could have very easily said “any deceptive conduct” , and that
	would have barred these claims . 716733_721932
*GROSS:	They chose not to do that . 721932_722823
*ROBE:	But they were (.) they were addressing a very specific decision

*GROSS:	That was false . 937299_937877
*GROSS:	The reason they were increasing it is because Charter was

*GROSS:	This is what they refer to as barter contracts , two companies

*SHAPI:	For example in section <eighteen a@l> [= 18(a)] , if you cause some
	other person to make a false statement in a financial statement ,
	you can be held liable , but they are not invoking it in section
	<eighteen> [= 18] . 2495590_2505820
*SHAPI:	Same thing under section <seventeen> [= 17] . 2505820_2507801
*SHAPI:	If you engage in a scheme to cause some falsehood , you can be
	prosecuted by the government . 2507801_2513676
*SHAPI:	But nowhere has Congress said that an individual litigant can bring
	a claim like that without regard for reliance and “in connection
	with” and the loss causation test . 2513676_2522235
*SOUT:	Let's assume there is reliance and loss causation . 2522235_2524265
*SOUT:	Let me ask a question very similar to what Justice Ginsburg has
	posed a couple of times . 2524265_2528514
*SOUT:	She has said is there a third category . 2528514_2530622
*SOUT:	My question is , is there an overlap ? 2530622_2533574
*SOUT:	Can there be an overlap ? 2533574_2535386
*SHAPI:	No , I don't think there can be . 2535386_2537853
*SOUT:	Why ? 2537853_2538165
*SHAPI:	Because Congress intended in section <twenty e@l> [= 20(e)] to have
	an expert agency address these cases and not to have the trial +/. 2538165_2545054
*SOUT:	Congress intended an expert agency to address solely
	aiding-and-abetting cases . 2545054_2549473
*SOUT:	My question is if there is an overlap (.) A , can there be an
	overlap ? 2549473_2556111
*SOUT:	And if so , I don't see why Congress's intent to reserve
	aiding-and-abetting alone to the agency affects the determination of
	this case . 2556111_2567326
*SHAPI:	+, We believe they are separate categories and that Central Bank
	tells us exactly who the primary violator is . 2567326_2572714
*SHAPI:	He is somebody who makes a statement that investors rely on in
	connection with securities transactions , and that is not these
	vendors . 2572714_2579977
*SHAPI:	That is exactly what section <twenty e@l> [= 20(e)] addresses and
	commits +/. 2579977_2583992
*SCAL:	Could you amend that to +/. 2583992_2585444
@G:	---
*SCAL:	say (.) you don't insist that he make a statement that invest (.)
	he could engage in a deceptive practice directed at investments ? 2585444_2595751
*SHAPI:	+, Absolutely . 2595751_2596033
*SHAPI:	Absolutely . 2596033_2596406
*SHAPI:	We don't quarrel over that , Justice Scalia . 2596406_2598235
*SOUT:	For example , for example , let's assume in this case that Charter
	said we've , we've got to let the investors know that our cost of
	doing business is going up , and we want to you make an announcement
	that you're jacking up your price <twenty> [= 20] percent . 2598235_2615634
*SOUT:	In that case there would be primary liability . 2615634_2618102
*SHAPI:	Absolutely . 2618102_2618821
*SOUT:	Why in that case is there not also aiding-and-abetting ? 2618821_2621945
*SOUT:	We know perfectly well why they are doing it , and they are doing
	it solely to aid and abet Charter in its scheme themselves enjoying
	a wash transaction . 2621945_2631409
*SOUT:	Why isn't that both primary and aiding-and-abetting ? 2631409_2634204
*SHAPI:	Well , it's primary because there is the communication to the
	market that's missing here . 2634204_2639077
*SOUT:	We know it's primary . 2639077_2639530
*SOUT:	Why isn't it also aiding-and-abetting ? 2639530_2640936
*SHAPI:	You can call it (.) both of those things . 2640936_2644263
*SOUT:	If you can call it , why isn't there the kind of overlap which
	raises the question that Justice Ginsburg has raised ? 2644263_2648387
*SHAPI:	You can't have primary liability , which they are asserting here ,
	without the statement to the market . 2648387_2654229
*SHAPI:	And it can be a statement by conduct , and it can be by nodding of
	the head . 2654229_2658383
*SOUT:	So you are saying there can be an overlap but there is no overlap
	that helps the Petitioner in this case ? 2658383_2664662
*SHAPI:	Oh , yes . 2664662_2665037
*SHAPI:	Nodding the head is the same thing as saying yes . 2665037_2668411
*SHAPI:	But it has to be made directly to an investor and cause reliance by
	that investor . 2668411_2672783
*SHAPI:	That's what's missing here . 2672783_2674158
*SHAPI:	So there is nothing wrong with the Eighth Circuit's decision . 2674158_2676485
*SHAPI:	It didn't address that refinement , because it has no bearing on
	this case . 2676485_2680641
*SHAPI:	So there is no point in reversing the decision . 2680641_2683530
*SHAPI:	It has to be affirmed in our view for want of reliance , for want
	of loss causation , for lack of “in connection with” , and because
	most importantly , Congress intended to remove this category of case
	and commit it to an expert agency as part of its very important
	reform effort to deal with excessive litigation that was harming our
	economy . 2683530_2701943
*SHAPI:	This was an important concept for Congress . 2701943_2704147
@G:	---
*SHAPI:	And it said it twice : First in the <P_S_L_R_A> [= PSLRA] in
	<nineteen ninety-five> [= 1995] , then in <twenty oh two> [= 2002] ,
	in the Sarbanes-Oxley law . 2704147_2711158
*SHAPI:	And it removed even claims that you mislead an auditor under
	section <three oh three> [= 303] of Sarbanes-Oxley . 2711158_2717593
*SHAPI:	And there is no savings clause there for private actions . 2717593_2720842
*SHAPI:	Congress refused to permit the private actions . 2720842_2722825
*SHAPI:	Instead , it permitted the <S_E_C> [= SEC] to bring intentional
	misconduct cases under section <twenty e@l> [= 20(e)] or negligent
	misconduct cases under section <three oh three> [= 303] or under
	section <thirteen> [= 13] . 2722825_2734243
*SHAPI:	And the <S_E_C> [= SEC] has a broad panoply of remedies . 2734243_2736743
*SHAPI:	It doesn't have to just allege intentional +/. 2736743_2738757
*GINS:	Does the <S_E_C> [= SEC] distinguish this kind of situation where
	silence is the essence of the thing for the deceiver , silence not
	speech ? 2738757_2746926
*GINS:	Does the <S_E_C> [= SEC] distinguish this from aiding-and-abetting
	? 2746926_2750253
*SHAPI:	+, Well , the <S_E_C's> [= SEC's] view is the one rejected by the
	Solicitor General , and that's this purpose-and-effect standard
	that's been advocated , which we think is hopelessly vague . 2750253_2760920
*SHAPI:	And it overrides the reliance requirement . 2760920_2763263
*SHAPI:	It overrides the “in connection with” requirement . 2763263_2765887
*SHAPI:	And it overrides loss causation , not to mention Central Bank . 2765887_2770369
*STEV:	<Mister> [= Mr.] Shapiro , what is your strongest case , in your
	view , for the reliance requirement ? 2770369_2772900
*SHAPI:	Central Bank itself . 2772900_2774212
*STEV:	Central Bank itself ? 2774212_2775867
*SHAPI:	Because the Court there said that even though the bank did
	something that was a secret agreement that facilitated the issuer's
	distribution of a false prospectus and caused all the harm to the
	shareholders , it was a direct sine qua non cause of all of that
	harm , that that was merely aiding and abetting , because there was
	no reliance on anything that the bank stated or anything that the
	bank had a duty to state because of a fiduciary relationship . 2775867_2801279
*SHAPI:	Now , the vendors here are even far more removed from investors
	than the bank was in Central Bank . 2801279_2807261
*SHAPI:	The investors knew about the bank in Central Bank , and they were
	relying on it to do its job . 2807261_2811930
*SHAPI:	But that was not sufficient because it made no statement that the
	investors relied on . 2811930_2816055
*SHAPI:	There is no communication here between these vendors and investors
	. 2816055_2821411
*SHAPI:	There is no way you could +/. 2821411_2821755
*STEV:	<Mister> [= Mr.] Shapiro , in your judgment , is the reliance
	requirement an element of the violation or of the private cause of
	action ? 2821755_2827864
*SHAPI:	+, It's the private cause of action . 2827864_2829300
*SHAPI:	An important point , Justice Stevens , because the <S_E_C> [= SEC]
	is not burdened with any of these elusive +/. 2829300_2834782
@G:	---
*SHAPI:	inquiries into but-for causation , speculative questions of
	indirect reliance ; none of that burdens the <S_E_C> [= SEC] . 2834782_2842388
*SHAPI:	And the <S_E_C> [= SEC] also has power to distribute funds to
	investors . 2842388_2845839
*SHAPI:	This is the better mousetrap that Congress prescribed for these
	kinds of cases . 2845839_2850447
*SHAPI:	It didn't want the trial lawyers to bring class actions that always
	result in settlements . 2850447_2855258
*ROBE:	Thank you , <Mister> [= Mr.] Shapiro . 2855258_2856430

*HUNGA:	+, No , Your Honor . 2936883_2937147
*HUNGA:	We haven't addressed the other elements and those (.) questions
	that we have (.) because there is no need to resolve them in this
	case and because they weren't resolved by the court of appeals or by
	the district court , we have chosen to focus on what we think is
	dispositive and what was raised and decided below , which is
	reliance . 2937147_2955858
*STEV:	You have not reached opinion as to whether there was a violation of
	the statute ? 2955858_2959232
*HUNGA:	Correct . 2959232_2959670
*SOUT:	Has the <S_E_C> [= SEC] publicly taken a position on that question
	? 2959670_2963480
*HUNGA:	I'm not sure of the answer to that question , Your Honor . 2963480_2968620
*HUNGA:	Certainly individual commissioners have given speeches and
	testified before Congress to the effect that the Commission voted in
	this case to agree with our position on deception , the position
	that's expressed in our brief , and by a three-to-two vote to
	disagree with the position on reliance that is expressed in our
	brief . 2968620_2986457

	Commission +/. 2986457_2989892
@G:	---
*HUNGA:	statement to that effect that's been publicly released . 2989892_2992500
*HUNGA:	As I said , the only deceptive conduct that was allegedly committed
	by Respondents in this case involves the backdating of contracts and
	the false justifications for the price increase . 2992500_3004918
*HUNGA:	That conduct was never disclosed to the market at any time during
	the class period , and therefore , could not have been relied on by
	the market or by Petitioners . 3004918_3015399
*HUNGA:	And as a consequence , under this Court's decisions in Central Bank
	and in Basic , reliance cannot be established because the
	presumption of reliance that Petitioner seeks to invoke requires as
	a prerequisite to its invocation the existence of a publicly
	disseminated statement from the defendant that was disseminated to ,
	and therefore , relied on by the market . 3015399_3037233
*HUNGA:	That did not happen here with respect to Respondents . 3037233_3040481
*GINS:	Could the <S_E_C> [= SEC] get any monetary recovery for the
	investors on your theory ? 3040481_3046808
*GINS:	You say yes , it's a deceptive practice , but this belongs in the
	<S_E_C's> [= SEC's] bailiwick , not in private suits ? 3046808_3054914
*HUNGA:	Yes , Your Honor . 3054914_3055508
*GINS:	Private suits ; obviously they are seeking damages for the decline
	in the share price . 3055508_3060286
*GINS:	What could the <S_E_C> [= SEC] (.) suppose it should take up this
	case (.) get by way of remedy ? 3060286_3067081
*HUNGA:	The <S_E_C> [= SEC] is entitled to obtain civil fines , as well as
	disgorgement remedies . 3067081_3073687
*GINS:	But there is no disgorgement here because the vendors didn't get
	anything . 3073687_3077888
*GINS:	For them it was a wash . 3077888_3079591

	right ? 3088822_3092446
*HUNGA:	+, If I may (.) yes , yes and no , I think is the answer to that
	question ; because under the fair funds provision of the
	Sarbanes-Oxley Act , section <three oh eight> [= 308] of
	Sarbanes-Oxley , the <S_E_C> [= SEC] is authorized to take fines and
	distribute those (.) add those to disgorgement relief (.) and
	distribute them to investors . 3092446_3110423
*GINS:	But there would be no disgorgement relief . 3110423_3112657

@G:	---
*HUNGA:	it appears that they obtained advertising that presumably had some
	value , although it didn't cost them anything ; and presumably the
	<S_E_C> [= SEC] could seek the value of that advertising . 3125932_3136132
*HUNGA:	As I said , in the Adelphia matter where the <S_E_C> [= SEC] did
	pursue the vendors that assisted Adelphia in a somewhat similar
	transaction , it obtained substantial monetary recoveries from them

*HUNGA:	I +/. 3146564_3147720
*GINS:	But did they receive something that they then disgorged ? 3147720_3151141
*HUNGA:	+, I believe the allegations were similar to those presented here .
	3151141_3153561
*HUNGA:	But in any event , certainly the <S_E_C> [= SEC] has the authority
	to proceed in that fashion , and additionally the Justice Department
	has the ability to proceed criminally and obtain substantial
	monetary sanctions , either as part of a deferred prosecution
	agreement , as part of a restitutionary sanction and the like ; but
	the fundamental point is that for the private right of action to
	apply , as this Court said in Central Bank , all of the elements of
	the private cause of action must be satisfied with respect to the
	individual defendant . 3153561_3182737
*HUNGA:	That is the line . 3182737_3183753
*ROBE:	Do you agree , do you agree with <Mister> [= Mr.] Shapiro , what I

*HUNGA:	Well , I wouldn't say that it occupies the field per se , but what
	it does do is (.) given the timing of this Court's decision in
	Central Bank in <nineteen ninety-four> [= 1994] , followed by
	Congress's considering the question whether to provide for secondary
	liability in private actions , and its decision not to authorize
	such secondary liability (.) what it does clearly suggest is that
	this Court ought not adopt the expansive view of the implied right
	of action that Petitioner is urging , but instead both because the
	Court is appropriately cautious in expanding liability under implied
	rights of action , and because Congress has now looked at this
	question , not once but twice , and has declined to provide
	secondary liability for secondary actors under the cause of action .

	also a (.) quite likely to be a primary violator , because they have
	spoken to the market . 3262018_3276995
*HUNGA:	The market is relying on their statements , and is aware that they
	are making them ; and so they would be both a primary violator , but
	could presumably be pursued as an aider and abettor . 3276995_3285148

	suggest that merely because reliance is not established , therefore
	“in connection with” must not also be established ; and that is one
	of the reasons why we think that the “in connection with” question
	is best resolved , not in this case , but in the case where it's
	been squarely presented , and preferably a government enforcement
	action where the government has an opportunity to tailor the case in
	an appropriate fashion . 3325944_3353090
*HUNGA:	The Court , as I said has been +/. 3353090_3357291
*ROBE:	It's at least a little awkward for you to say we should wait for a
	case in which it's been fully presented when the argument you're
	making here wasn't fully presented , or at least not decided below .

*HUNGA:	+, I think it was , Your Honor . 3366256_3367693
*HUNGA:	It was certainly briefed and argued in both the district court and
	the court of appeals . 3367693_3370958
*HUNGA:	The district court squarely resolved it at page <forty-one a@l>
	[= 41a] of the petition appendix . 3370958_3374847
*HUNGA:	The court of appeals addressed reliance at page <ten a@l> [= 10a]
	of the petition appendix . 3374847_3378377

*HUNGA:	fully orbed discussion . 3379018_3380922
*ROBE:	I understood the court of appeals' decision to be based on its
	determination that there was no deceptive act because there was no
	statement or omission . 3380922_3387374
*HUNGA:	But on page <ten a@l> [= 10a] , they also talk about reliance ,
	Your Honor ; and what's important here to understand is that
	Petitioner's theory of reliance rests on a misstatement , because
	they say the market (.) it's a basic presumption of reliance based
	on the fraud-on-the-market theory case . 3387374_3401836
*HUNGA:	That's the only allegation of reliance in the complaint ; that
	requires something publicly disseminated . 3401836_3405710
*HUNGA:	The only thing that was publicly disseminated is the statement . 3405710_3408240
*HUNGA:	What the court of appeals said is , that doesn't work , there was
	no reliance because Respondents didn't make any publicly
	disseminated statement . 3408240_3415096
*HUNGA:	So it's actually , perhaps not a complete , but certainly a
	perfectly reasonable resolution of the reliance question ; and
	therefore it is squarely presented . 3415096_3423531

*HUNGA:	that is the Respondents . 3458799_3459954
*HUNGA:	Again as I say , it's not as complete a discussion of the reliance
	issue as we would have thought appropriate if we had been writing
	the opinion , but it certainly does touch on the question and we
	think it's wholly presented . 3459954_3470263

@G:	---
*GROSS:	that the advertising cost the vendors no money . 3480290_3483836
*GROSS:	Well , if the advertising cost them no money , why was there a
	contract that they entered into for the purchase of advertising ? 3483836_3490989
*GROSS:	Clearly it was designed to give the false appearance that Charter
	had this additional <seventeen million dollars> [= $17 million] in
	revenue . 3490989_3498501
*GROSS:	Number two , the <S_E_C> [= SEC] did take a position in the Simpson
	case as it submitted an amicus brief ; Commissioner Cox testified
	before a House committee this past spring that they wanted to submit
	the same brief on the same points supporting the position that we
	are taking here ; and the testimony of Commissioner Cox is appended
	to the briefs of Congressmen Franks and Conyers . 3498501_3527004
*GROSS:	Number three , Central Bank did not turn on reliance . 3527004_3530535
*GROSS:	Central Bank turned on the issue of deceptive conduct . 3530535_3534174
*GROSS:	There was no deceptive conduct in that case . 3534174_3536454
*GROSS:	The plaintiffs conceded there was no deceptive conduct ; the court
	of appeals and the district court said there was no deceptive
	conduct ; it was strictly an aiding-and-abetting case . 3536454_3545778
*GROSS:	With respect to the reliance issue in Central Bank , what the Court
	did say was under plaintiff's theory he wouldn't have to prove
	reliance . 3545778_3553495

*GROSS:	Number three , with respect to <twenty e@l> [= 20(e)] , how do my
	friends on the other side read <twenty e@l> [= 20(e)] in connection
	with section <nine> [= 9] and section <eighteen> [= 18] of the
	Exchange Act , each of which provides remedies and private rights of
	actions against multiple parties ? 3565926_3582998
*GROSS:	Under their definition , that would appear to be displaced by
	<twenty e@l> [= 20(e)] . 3582998_3587277
*GROSS:	<twenty e@l> [= 20(e)] was not designed , it was not intended to do
	anything but to give the <S_E_C> [= SEC] the right to bring the very
	type of aiding-and-abetting action that this Court barred in Central
