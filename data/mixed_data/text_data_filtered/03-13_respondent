would nt violate establishment clause guess addressing whether free exercise violation violate student right free exercise religion maybe expensive go school violate free exercise religion right well let ask suppose state school voucher program court indicated could upheld zelman case state decides give school vouchers use religious parochial schools take position must one voucher program fund private religious schools voucher program position well mean would nt follow saying today nt know mean state says schools going program give vouchers use schools certain grade level assuming teachers qualified teachers refrain making program available use religious schools urging would major impact would voucher programs well criteria sure surely state decide fund public schools starts funding private schools get religious question say publish private school must publish must support religious schools well could say publish private schools except sectarian schools issue yeah even though quite state laws constitutional provisions around country provide nt yeah decision could broad impact assume mister mr sekulow may ask question asked ms ms pierce think really case turns space one state permitted permitted fund establishment clause must fund free exercise clause fills space candid saying voucher going give private school ca nt leave parochial schools certainly said program suppose state would say going fund professional education lawyers doctors architects engineers going fund people divinity program would qualify would fall also would include program includes professions save one ministry understand answer justice oconnor decide favor necessarily commit proposition elementary secondary school voucher program must include religious schools includes private schools seems case resolved much narrower issue college student required surrender conscientious beliefs declaring major otherwise would completely funded school nt see interest seems severe violation religious conscience think quite different overall neutrality principle would foreclose court voucher issue certainly arguing mean brief presentation certainly urges us go route looking funding issues dealt differently requirement funding something public funds purposes okay let assume public schools private schools including religious private schools accredited whatever way state accredits criterion apart religious education simply ultimate recipient voucher accredited school seems following justice oconnor question argument would made case state says allow voucher spent private school private religious school argument justice kennedy suggesting moment ago religious student must somehow surrender conscientious belief go religious school seek enrolled nonreligious private school public one get voucher nt see argument would applicable argument making sure wash everybody agrees everybody criterion fund religious training religion religious fact similar argument would made religious school teaches religion private school nt teach religion well may show state draws kind funny line maybe bad job line drawing admit quite sure draw way basic proposition state raises position fund ministerial education education religious versus funding kinds training argument seems free exercise clause would voucher case argument making right mister mr well many states know knowledgeable things many states voucher programs would allow students go private school know elite academy allow go religious schools suppose could changed mind taken another major courses postponed decision matter conscience nt would nt correct incorrect state would fund student majored literature institution sectarian instructors taught literature religious perspective correct yes well state saying nt know escape broader ground state saying look understand know applying standard kinds anomalies get maybe case one large say nt want spend much state money program subsidiary know odd example nt matter people major philosophy likely become priests least spend lot time studying theology major theology spend lot time studying theology going far like many administrative lines crude effort identify people taking much time totally religiouslyoriented matters course unconstitutional accept argument state must treat religious study way broad ground reject broad ground nt quite see moment accept narrow one turns details administrability line mister mr sekulow think justice breyer getting point tried get part flip side justice kennedy asked certainly standing tell us oh restrictive said simply going fund scholarships students go sectarian schools might right mean nt want win ground school generous fund would nt better said go school except church school nt know case says less significant interest state latitude discriminating religion nt know case said hope nt yeah may ask ask broader question number briefs discussed breathing space establishment clause free exercise clause take position position whether breathing space yeah example go far contend violation time violation establishment clause free exercise clause would necessarily kick looking want reserve rest time mister mr sekulow give example case state say know give funding religious schools want nt want give example would legitimate view free opened play joints religion clauses said ca nt open particular religious presentation nt correct think let say think position think position although certain religious funding may violate establishment clause follow state must fund state general program funding instruction religious instruction got fund religious instruction middle ground play joints correct thank mister mr sekulow general olson hear well course couple centuries practice country funding religious instruction tax money mean old country nt free exercise chilled ca nt practice religion always would become minister pay prohibited something every citizen still addressing question freedom practice religion wants practice impaired practices without subsidy nt coercion religion suppose would okay limit exclusion jewish theology catholic theology response would nt nt coerce religion nt difference would plainly violate establishment clause free exercise clause issue take position breathing space response following concern brought times like address directly case perhaps small matter distinction nt make much sense makes implications case breathtaking would mean side wins every program educational programs nursing programs hospital programs social welfare programs contracting programs throughout governments would go go claim instance purely secular must fund religions want thing religions way though may excellent principle may get fights billions billions dollars something written know right like address agree take position affirm court appeals accept position court committed school voucher issue say school voucher program excludes parochial schools practical may ask want sentence practical implication farreaching tone voice suggested maybe good thing nt general may ask question mean whole argument neutrality comes argument think following following distinction side says washington says look line drawn funding catholics protestants atheists whatnot line drawn line funding education religion education says catholics believe atheists believe hand education says belief valid ought go persuade people hold belief say distinction trying draw distinction invalid neutrality criteria rosenberger said opinion rosenberger said people proselytizing distinction drawing distinction believing proselytizing one hand valid instruction people believe fact rosenberger authority rejection distinction oh look writing dissent agree laughter could nt could nt get four colleagues agree went another another course argument good even bother criterion direct funding religion could drawn line thank general olson ms ms pierce three minutes remaining
