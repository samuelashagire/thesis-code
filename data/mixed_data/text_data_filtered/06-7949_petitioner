thirty years gave zero wrong suggesting factor least start saying something unusual case ought take closer look well point looking broad range cases ca nt anything right say broad range shows defendants get sentence ten years jail case person got probation court look reasons explain difference justify difference give rebuttal time mister mr green one question think gotten track little bit question presented extraordinary circumstances test proportionality review talking lot district court judges wrong whatever want call saying something norm ought good reason norm question presented case thank mister mr green mister mr dreeben thank mister mr green case submitted problem would nt judge second case give consideration required abuse review give consideration sort norm circuit nt stand either letthemloose judge hanging judge nt abuse discretion least require broader view simply literally case court would nt least chief justices hypothetical would nt possibility looking cases rather automatically affirming abuse review okay saying saying two things saying got follow guidelines depart guidelines got based facts case way relevant facts case put latter criterion saying think justice scalia concern really saying got find case somehow outlier broad range cases policy fit different thing general disagreement policy nt saying facts case crucial appropriate determination sure reasoning articulated reasoning accepted reasoning accepted every case amounts effect rejection policy certain swath individuals relatively young individuals judge saying age relevant policy says age rejection policy saying judge disagrees general matter policy could make exception disagreement still seems reasoning rejected policy respect certain class defendant
