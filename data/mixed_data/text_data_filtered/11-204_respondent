relief want specific performance plea bargain nt correct come light come prosecutor attention intervening time client committed four five shootings would still entitled specific performance mean pretty incredible nt matter defendant done discovered done interim committed five murders ten murders wipe mind get get plea bargain offered early point investigation case well nt know going hard show think feasible draw distinction case arguably inaccurate legal advice case defense attorney simply makes terribly mistaken calculation chances favorable verdict trial favorable plea bargain offered caps guy possible sentence let say three years defense attorney says got great shot acquittal let go trial going rip prosecution witnesses apart trial turns disaster convicted counts twentyfive years think impossible rule want us adopt applied situation well situation defendant turns plea turned defendant goes trial facts facts would make remedy specific performance correct remedy situation recommend recommending specific performance remedy case agree remedy remedy makes modicum sense remedy giving new trial person already fair trial makes zero sense looking situation said leave discretion trial judge discretion remedy situation specific performance would appropriate would remedy claim violation think length complexity trial bearing relatively short simple trial let say prosecutor offers plea deal case trial going take six months going cost million dollars try case going cases wo nt able try plea rejected case tried afterwards remedy reinstate plea offer predicated relieving prosecutor burden try case justice breyer permits add addendum give reasons might agree way viewing read lower court decisions said nt ineffectiveness trying get better deal think translating said reasonable view court prosecutor may think lesser charge guy really wanted kill woman would hit head chest aimed low really angry shooting enough hit okay died okay really nt heinous intent execute gunshot brain hoping negotiate something better justice breyer shaking head fact aedpa aedpa case give deference state courts nt resolve case give deference finding begging question okay yes think justice breyer first statement prove guy going take plea sense giving remedy would never sought right goes back think justice alito chief chief justice question basis judge reject plea said earlier put aside information learned trial really nub case grounds proposing judge use reject plea counsel defense trial defense trial deny committed act shooting trial case cases motions kind brought trial judges defense mistaken identity nt judges often find defendant proven would taken plea cases trial defendant pleading misidentification nt act cases trial judges permit nt find defendant met burden proving would taken plea thought case correct wrong client told attorney beginning want plea think got ineffective assistance yes controverted would gotten fiftyone months sixtyeight certainly controverted two interventions prosecutor say deal withdrawing even initial acceptance judge say think fiftyone sixtyeight entirely improper man judge judge knows plea let say knows plea bargain also knows one crimes felon possession alone sentencing range eightyone one thirtyfive without considering anything happened trial judge knows plea bargain less man charged felon possession seems unlikely judge would accepted plea bargaining fiftyone sixtyeight crimes charged may true sentence range eightyone one thirtyfive felon possession unanimity remedy court said writ shall granted conditioned state taking action offer fiftyone eightyfive months plea nt bind judge bind prosecutor removes possibility prosecutor saying would withdrawn initial offer prosecutor remedy remedy uniform prosecutor discretion judge conceded conceded fair trial case ca nt charade still fair turns ms ms newman says ca nt accept happens new yeah judge goes back judge agree send back judge reinstate offer okay accepts offer goes judge judge says outrageous going approve plea bargain happens would new trial okay judge turns prior trial valid right wait ca nt perfect either another trial although found guilty jury twelve entirely fair proceeding else nt new trial like factual variation think justifies categorically different remedy mean seems remedies good bad factual mean give example different remedies certain fact situation could make one okay okay right okay okay factual circumstances made okay nt nt blame laughter nt nt suggestion set aside perfectly fair conviction hypothetical going set aside think put back prejudice unless would accepted deal going know would course going say would trial judge going make credibility determination issue guess credibility determination nt know going think answer chief justice question yes circuits follow rule nt right flood gates opened go ahead perhaps lack unanimity remedy question appropriate mean people trying suggest different remedies perhaps one way deal remedy question recognize cases present different factual circumstances lot variation give substantial amount discretion lower courts work best remedy consistent factual variation would nt problem problem justice alito hypothetical take order would say prosecution reasonable time extend offer accepted go judge judge nt accept plea ca nt make bigger problem case may one looked nt see ineffective assistance counsel within aedpa aedpa meaning two courts state said ineffective look somewhat ambiguous best sixth circuit saying well know sides agree mean sides could nt make us decide case saying murder fact mean supposed find tough case read record opinion moment perhaps one else ineffective assistance counsel sixth circuit could set aside contrary finding state court would nt remedy judging said order saying prosecution reinstitute plea bargain give week whatever imagine defendant says accept go judge would judge freedom accept reject rejects plea agreement defendant must plead plead guilty guilty whatever flows flows suggestion perfect mine perfect laughter nt would right would suggestion new trial even though trial took place two years ago whatever correct nt end argument defense counsel best thing communicate plea offer get client found guilty go back say oh way nt tell gets whole new trial well let go back becoming convinced trying justice scalia suggested maybe work better say first throw defendant unless convinced ineffective assistance also would made difference would accepted plea bargain hold plea bargain open go judge like plea bargain ninety percent time judge say fine end judge decide case would reject plea bargain one variety reasons assumption wrong reinstate previous trial judge say tried convicted end wrong remedy mean muck criminal justice system way think pretty much justice scalia suggested trying think think maybe okay yes judge supposed let say remedy goes back judge trying unwind clock whatever metaphor judge prescind knowledge learned trial well asking conscientious decisionmaker asking advice know details crime horrific would expected heard trial somehow forget prescind answer yes ignore everything learned trial well say administrative matter think concern plea negotiations discussions myriad circumstances defense attorney water cooler prosecutor walked says thinking offering good bargain jones case knows going prosecutor court next day really beat thinks going soften nt communicate client prosecutor later says withdrawn going inquiries post hoc negotiations discussions seems absent rule like nt think authority impose plea offers must writing stated specificity proposing simply unworkable think answer chief justice question chief justice said going know show prejudice right saying unfair fair trial saying unfair fair trial nt correct position said earlier district court trial court judge still retains discretion whether approve plea bargain right whether accept yes well bargain sentence includes sentence correct discretion discretion allowed take consideration happened respect guilt innocence result trial imposing sentence approving nothing learned trial take deficient performance ever going know defendant would accepted plea agreement accepting chance going scotfree going fair trial assumption may acquitted judge supposed say mean presumably defendant always say would taken deal better judge supposed go back decide whether true judge judge ever going know able decide whether defendant would accepted deal defendant choice lawyer choice defendant choice ineffectiveness question understand taken case concessions side talking prejudice question judge supposed know people different people willing take chance okay let say twenty percent chance person found guilty people say willing take chance nt want chance going jail willing roll dice people say much whether want go jail may cut one way judge supposed decide ask take chances judge decide whether would take deal look evidence say boy would take deal laughter oh never say possibility acquittal juries decide convict matter evidence jury us ex ante decide guy definitely going lose let waste time juries nt want say often certainly inconceivable may decide whatever reason going convict guy right said want make sure understood point said defense mean nt frivolous defense literally put defense said state prove case nt done something jury could accepted right even legally true shoot person waist defense see reasonable juror saying probably nt intend kill shot waist maybe bad strategy thank counsel mister mr bursch four minutes
