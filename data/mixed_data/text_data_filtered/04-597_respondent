considered problem mean someone found guilty beyond reasonable doubt nt see relevant go sentencing say oh doubts mean finding beyond reasonable doubt nt reasonable doubt left nt see open argument say consider evidence shows good person underneath moral values ought respected something like capable good things nt see argue doubt sounds like trying relitigate question sentencing hearing certainly eighth amendment require extent oregon supreme court thought rested holding ought reject hand well court remand ought straightened eighth amendment require relitigation defendant time murder basis beyond reasonable doubt finding guilt well odd almost though appoint amicus counsel argue support merits mean nt seem strange response nt one thing say intentional include deliberate thing say nt nt commit crime first place two quite different things put make concrete case nt see would mean action intentional question whether deliberate planning would gone different timeframe still nt still nt understand say proof conviction guilt guilt intentional conduct simple story told wanted go one house many lights house frustrated wanted go someplace else came upon aunt uncle defendant former girlfriend whatever oregon law might say say appears supreme oregon supreme court acting thought compulsion eighth amendment wrong make argument oregon law without eighth amendment constraint seem court operating assumption eighth amendment required let alibi evidence vacate case remanded ground assume still open point oregon supreme court error status testimony tried get admitted ground nt way handle matter rather express mooting case course would still remain whether mooted case whether vacated left oregon supreme court whether let evidence would still remain question kind instruction jury given regarding consideration evidence purposes determining whether guilty person given death penalty rather purpose considering whether guilt clear enough mean issue would still remain would nt would nt understand going argue jury going argue jury know yes client convicted evidence guilt really clear take nt want make argument oregon supreme court says make argument eighth amendment requires able make argument state says eighth amendment requires thing issue nt gone away still case entitled get evidence oregon law question evidence properly used jury decided oregon supreme court basis eighth amendment basis oregon statute penalty phase penalty phase nt already found guilt phase found guilty murder nt intend kill seems strange think cases require death eligibility told us additional evidence deliberation put sentencing phase saying going would pass used two trials mean know whole problem client tried whether committed offense found guilty want relitigate matter nt nt basis constitution requires able relitigate matter two times criminal proceeding nt seem right thought well guess guess depends mean alibi mean alibi part offense somewhere thought alibi meant guilty thought alibi general williams one question sure goes eighthamendment question us honestly nt understand statute says convicted aggravated murder aggravated murder sentencing jury shall presented following questions number one whether conduct defendant caused death deceased committed deliberately reasonable expectation death deceased another would result nt find order convict aggravated murder plus okay gotcha oregon law clear want put mother stand want go anything nt raised trial mean right want know ambiguous look get go something otherwise otherwise relevant therefore want reason think relevant constitutional holding oregon supreme court want go something decide whether otherwise relevant want ask thing question whether transcript live witness nt know question depends constitutional holding want know want go things original trial yes okay right saying look minute might equivocal quite right leading laughter nt mean ca nt say yes decide right decide bound answer think answer yes want go otherwise relevant things like know answer want know laughter pass pass think long think decide whether otherwise relevant totally open honest laughter tricky want know go words otherwise relevant oregon statute otherwise relevant particularly respect question residual doubt really would like answer possible right said relevance residual doubt relevant reason relevant constitution united states requires jury hear focusing want know want go otherwise relevant reason okay let go constitutional issue let imagine trial trial lot evidence alibi state court says law person go sentencing phase jury heard okay take account moreover tell consider okay state law happens appeal middle go back sentencing introduce transcripts moreover introduce live witnesses say said nothing else saying constitutional right present additional witness matter already litigated go things trial mygoodness real evidence alibi nt put first time fact good evidence forth state waste time hear alibi nt put first time mean know saying constitution protects little skeptical want know answer agreeing insofar right put put first time agree one said wanted something else would nt say nt want something else want part constitution protect willing least hypothetically go protection already heard example single important feature leading juries recommend death apparently studies residual doubt every juror hears sentencing matters directly trial automatically takes account therefore resentenced new jury kind right otherwise cruel unusual made argument nt make seems several arguments might make favor oregon supreme court approach least concede oregon control evidentiary rules whether matter relevant form comes et cetera two sixteen yes two questions may one course would nt alibi evidence would already rejected whether deliberateness would support putting alibi evidence second question wanted sure clear intend future hearing introduce anything transcript prior proceeding intend introduce live witnesses may perhaps able oregon law got impression motion dismiss writ improvidently granted nt see anything unequivocally establishing record put oh okay definitely case us really basis motion dismiss writ improvidently granted true know asked decide whether oregon supreme court correctly interpreted federal constitution seem making argument effect well nt really need holding prevail oregon law going make argument support decision made oregon supreme court well mister mr wolf misunderstood something going new sentencing also going new trial mentioned earlier defect trial oh okay nt understand answer light previous discussion deliberate deliberately oregon courts take position sentencing phase deliberately requirement must judged introduced guilt phase thought well nt matter mean question oregon supreme court quite clear based decision eighth amendment various provisions oregon evidence law argue eighthamendment case supreme court win eighth amendment leave courthouse say well nt want anymore think moots case still decision binding case giving right admit evidence residual doubt retrial nt question doubt state supreme court decision based eighth amendment okay said alibi defense rejected prior jury relevant eighth amendment okay brings question particularly resentencing provision looks like sentencing trial going rerun guilt trial main evidence want put alibi evidence nt going say mother going say home presumably state gets put witnesses saying people saw blah blah blah trial want put new new evidence relevant alibi degree guilt want retain right put whatever evidence relevant questions well discussion mother go back put anything whether presented right eighth amendment requires according oregon supreme court okay thank counsel ms ms williams two minutes remaining thank ms ms williams case submitted well intend mister mr wolf view direction discussion going want go back something really think thought passed would like go back get clear recollection stated answer justice stevens currently maintain right recall mother stand sentencing proceeding question prompted motion question present intention call mother stand present intention use mother testimony understand admissible going call intend call asking want know whether representation intend call live witness resentencing okay
