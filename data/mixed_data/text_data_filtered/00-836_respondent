think exception well socalled brady violation facts nt known maybe immediately sentencing proceeding new crime well dna dna claim death case coming later true custis nt could gone back state court yes said could gone maryland twentytwo fiftyfour review maryland leaving open possibility say somebody position quorum nobis proceeding state gets knocked state law saying situation government rethinking whether succeed even way time get knocked state court could come back federal court twentytwo fiftyfive say state knocked mr mister mr dreeben nt know focus upon expectation defendant time pleaded guilty opposed expectation time committed later crime think would unconstitutional state say anyone prior conviction record right obtained manner long gideon complied anyone record commits later crime gets longer sentence knows rules commits later crime knows pleaded guilty former crime knows anyone pleaded guilty former crime get longer sentence nt expectation concerned statutory question though constitutional question whether statute sort described say would constitutional sort nt fortiori true defendant complaining likewise constitutional thank mister mr dreeben mister mr tanaka seven minutes remaining recognize said custis structural fundamental area gideon recognize judge bribed subsumed category facially valid yes thought concerned people nineteen seventytwo something appeared fairly minor individual convicted told somebody go plead guilty going big deal idea nt get correct advice goes pleads guilty totally confused state proceeding person going jail life later crime although look happened would obviously unconstitutional earlier conviction case worried get rid cases strict burden proof rules front us cases question nt person like able demonstrate obvious fact earlier conviction obviously unconstitutional give answer custis says could reply well language statute although running around robin barn something weird procedural way better let later sentencing proceeding could say guess nt know much stretch would could say person obviously convicted unconstitutionally underscore obviously get rid nonobvious cases strict burdens proof right obviously convicted unconstitutionally person forum somewhere point prison life vast majority fine also cases like somebody robbed chicken coop know eighteen years old twelve years later chicken coop come back put prison life also least cases think maybe nt get good advice first time certain exceptions make argument even gideon violation words say final sentencing defendant either counsel inadequate counsel nt learn gideon violation already served sentence crime gideon violation could raise federal sentencing say gets sentence mistake sentencing judge relies prior state conviction invalid gideon violation nobody called attention court would true even sentence served gideon violation would always served would nt could nt go twentytwo fiftyfive call court attention get relief view even even inadequate assistance counsel course got case facts favorable government generally cases much closer like seventh circuit case evidence really quite disturbing whether person actually received fair proceeding would apply rule regardless strong proof regardless serious violation unless gideon well custis really holding meaning nine twentyfour e course one reason permissible normally second chance prove really happened part given case open view take even prior conviction set aside state proceedings federal proceedings would justify reduction federal sentence view agree apparently justice scalia would laughter last sentence opinion says may attack state sentence maryland federal habeas review four well nt confine twentytwo fiftyfour yes therefore part guess giving us trouble reason giving trouble number one course dissenter custis maybe looking trouble court majority custis left question open whether could another means challenge challenge federal sentencing proceeding number two textually petitioner wants fitted within terms twentytwo fiftyfive issue guess boils think nt think custis controlling issue boils accept argument balance struck issues finality fairness require point far service original sentence seventyeight sentence example concerned litigation got stop seems balance entirely different get subsequent proceeding example stake finality fairness argument say sentence five years ten years first conviction whatever sentence potentially life suddenly stakes change radically federal proceeding old finalityfairness balance simply nt apply terms changed terms change radically nt possible reassess balance say okay even though could nt litigate state purposes litigate federal purposes yeah custis may true number one custis depended part statutory construction reason looked text sentencing enhancement statute number two custis left question open court telling subsequent situation left open oh entirely right nt nt front nt court also refer possibility litigation federal habeas right basis could federal habeas litigation would federal habeas litigation connection later federal sentence even though subject litigation might would validity earlier state sentence therefore seems left open certainly include nt know limited reason may textual reason custis going text enhancement statute may wanted sentencing congress wanted sentencing clean simple leaving later attack worked afterwards words get shut away let litigate long wants let assume though realize nt concede course assume custis leave open possibility litigation would go back say balance argument point balance finality fairness changes radically go limited jeopardy imprisonment state conviction potentiality life imprisonment balance radically affected nt due process purposes opportunity litigate federal level even though state proceeding past final state purposes perfectly fair due process purposes others fairness standard hold prisoner bargain knew terms trouble terms changed difficult litigate later also difficult stay prison life terms changed calculus says said first instance fair hold bargain nt apply terms changed right let understand argument nt see sound truth real world prisoners enter guilty pleas thinking possibility life prison twentyfive years later crime nt committed yet mean nt think realistic say knew known could happen serious consequences yes serious consequence different order well recidivism yes least point history living time great many prior convictions considered threestrikes laws let alone federal threestrikes law could nt possibly contemplation people entered guilty pleas suffered convictions twentyfive years ago prisoner problem government nt
