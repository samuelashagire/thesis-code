nt position decision court entitled stare decisis protection nt majority opinion case think pretty important decisions court result majority opinion want us adopt blanket rule right constitutional decisions court decided majority opinion stare decisis effect argument well think important court consistent doctrine stare decisis doctrine ca nt overrule decisions nt like stick decisions majority like still looking understanding stare decisis means constitutional cases suggestion justice ginsburg gather position narrow decision stare decisis less weight factors less weight nt controlling though insufficient weight defending case involving drug weight client maintained nothing drugs would proceed argument would drugs drugs nt nt weigh one kilo booker booker entitled greater stare decisis weight harris mcmillan counsel could address issue important one stare decisis hone well problem whether right wrong absolutely right plurality opinion adversary says states passed laws relying federal system structured around nt damage great claim potential damage say address please practical consequences many many federal courts aware already charging nine twentyfour c say statistics least nine twentyfour c effect argument fixing sentence different giving judge discretion ignores fact judge might given less depriving constitutional right jury decide sentence could judge decide sentence could booker booker logic apprendi even statutes higher maximum jury judge constrained within different maximum argument ms ms maguire nt nt take position stare decisis effect unanimous recent unanimous decision court obviously would carry weight one plurality opinion nt say nt question yes question degrees respect would give former decision mentioned drug weight let making argument would mean drug weight also found jury length sentence depend drug weight nt distinguished mcmillan distinguished harris distinguish mcmillan grounds distinguishing sixth amendment case even though opinion refers sixth amendment nt care mostly issue whether mcmillan sixth amendment case part whole nt know say nt nt decide cases case mostly says decide says would nt problem question decided jury requiring decided jury eliminate problem mixing mixing ms ms maguire could repeat first sentence uttered argument hesitated jump early could repeat verbatim maybe committed memory good good counsel often nt laughter think said decide fact causes defendant subject penalty would otherwise subject fact case mandatory minimum defendant could given mandatory minimum judge mandatory minimum increase penalty defendant subject subject justice kagan example penalty one years one year ten judge even without statute mentioned could given seven years brandished gun really increase penalty exposed thought apprendi addressed increase penalty exposed decide going rob bank know go going get one ten years mandatory minimum get one ten years complaint far apprendi concerned nt leading harsh harsh sentence whole point apprendi lead sentence greater judge would otherwise authorized impose case mandatory minimum never judge could impose hanging judge know hanging judges bleeding heart judges mandatory minimum simply says know nt care kind judge least much nt expose defendant greater penalty risk one ten years seems quoted apprendi correctly saying jury decide fact increases sentence defendant exposed language quoted accurate mandatory minimum increase sentence defendant exposed could get mandatory minimum sentence even mandatory minimum prescribed exposed sentence one ten years mandatory minimum says must impose seven years brandishes sentence exposed one ten years mandatory minimum change risk one ten years true true must acknowledge theory apprendi think logic apprendi jury decide increases sentence defendant exposed eliminates discretion court exposed nt mandatory minimum case booker case maximum increased basis judge finding fact maximum increased situation booker exposure defendant indeed increased basis judge fact finding instead one ten statute booker said brandish gun get fifteen quite different situation saying yeah still hook one ten brandish got get seven workable mean argue whether right wrong argue whether created incongruity system nt last number years suggested perfectly workable everybody knows supposed everybody workable ms ms maguire could take different kind question let assume statute said carrying gun offense range five ten years realize goes real word let say five ten years congress said setting penalty within range judge shall consider whether defendant brandished gun whether defendant discharged gun statute said would constitutional right okay constitutional judge say seven years brandished nine years discharged makes unconstitutional makes violation sixth amendment congress provides something extra statute says shall consider brandishing discharging find brandishing get seven find discharging get nine well seems right definitional matter descriptive matter guess question difficulty matter purposes sixth amendment jury exact thing jury nt anything either examples difference example number one said constitutional example number two congress giving instruction judge nothing taken away jury well apprendi goes ways mean best sentence apprendi sentences apprendi go towards justice scalia suggested question increasing maximum jury authorized sure get language apprendi guess question matter principle completely understand defendant would care question create sixth amendment violation know jury congress decreasing judge discretion either way jury nt deciding question strategic decision think lawyer make justice alito real problem nt put defense difficult position nt difficult say nothing drugs plus drugs nt weigh certain amount think hearing every case going want witnesses going insist jury determination amount kind hearing justice alito says nt put defense counsel difficult position well getting far one answer could say order preserve constitutional right want us bifurcated trial thought might say good extra problem laughter sounds like sounds like argument wrong course first step stare decisis analysis nt sound responsive justice kagan question sense unworkable started mister mr chief justice laughter sure emphasized several times takes away discretion judge seems matter congress judiciary sixth amendment question thank counsel mister mr dreeben thank counsel case submitted
