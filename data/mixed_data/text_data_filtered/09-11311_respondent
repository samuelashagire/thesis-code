agency comes back says know many designs cars cars particularly sedans light added safety feature vans may size vans going require going let manufacturers depending design car choose two going set minimum standard every one many different designs despite ruling manufacturer says costs two pennies put light sedan know agency said safer nt want nt van nt reason except two pennies nt want case preempted merely given option different hypothetical agency said could obstruction entry manufacturers design without obstruction really case different one hypothetical wait minute answering flexibility ensure manufacturer imposes thinks safety chooses option safest inducement manufacturer put light sedan put seatbelt two without causing added safety risk preempted inducement always case agency sets minimum setting minimum basically saying nt want mandate disagreeing statute term says minimum nt preempt state common law still sure creating option different minimum default always manufacturers option minimum definition gives manufacturers options nt explained minimum definition gives freedom manufacturer impose chooses option tell manufacturer pick think safest sorry still nt responded manufacturers always risk common law claims statute statute expressly says every design choice manufacturer makes almost situation common law effect puts risk jury decide whether enough cost benefit analysis technology nt know agency creates minimum choice implicitly preempted application state law nt center seat aisle seat issue issue whether feasible car whether feasible elsewhere goes point light sedan versus van letting manufacturers decide best choice mister mr garre mister mr garre geier think justice breyer called attention agency informed court tort suits go contradiction government view safety standards set would disturbed would impeded opinion said assign weight department transportation view tort suit would stand obstacle accomplishment federal safety standards court gives weight agency says geier nt equally give weight nhtsa nhtsa telling us conflict says rule sets statute calls minimum standard court court saying wanted agency feel good statement mean

displaced nt assume standard agency set agency said minimum standard unless agency tells us preemptive tort suits nineteen eightynine thought advance child seats early eighties eightynine nineteen eightynine government nt mean says way told far encouraging type one along government says yes type two better seatbelt say reason making mandatory cost benefit analysis nt think impose minimum thought told one manufacturer think general motors mentioned type two belt uniformly nt understand looked diagram talked center seat aisle seat know terminology aisle two seats nt prohibit sure allowed nt nt allow juries take account changes time mean say agency rule spoke situation time nothing agency find says agency really wanted mix options mean said manufacturer geier think could avoided agency would simply say want maximum minimum easy say nt found agencies saying nt know forced deal situation situation geier filled indications really wanted mix unusual circumstances present point something shows also said say practical thing theoretical legal thing likely know forty thousand pages agency record actually mean say people agency second likely sg sg office go tell government continuously says agency means agency telling yes means chances come better correct conclusion law clerks lot right laughter practical sorry practical idea think underlies said geier dealing nineteen eightynine primarily nineteen eightynine think least quoted side agency said well see lap shoulder belts actually effective reluctant recommend center seat aisle seat people might get caught spools hand manufacturers may able work problem therefore encourage manufacturer try figure way around sg sg looking stuff says see nt mind manufacturers put another legal obligation objection making manufacturers certain yet read said wrote course cases manufacturers able design install lap shoulder belts seating positions adjacent aisleways without interfering aisleway purpose allowing access rearward seating positions nhtsa nhtsa encourages manufacturers nt sound like tort suit would require principle least things taken account arguments think justice sotomayor saying huge problem manufacturers called tort suits different places different juries different states beyond scope case agency wants displace tort suits often say purpose something like saying intended displaced nt making comment rather form question maybe nt understand nt would make job simpler tell response justice sotomayor tell whether agency giving options simply setting minimum minimum course always gives options thank counsel mister mr buchanan four minutes
