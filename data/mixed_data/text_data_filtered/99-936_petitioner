dss dss routine urine specimen collected someone hospital tests employed mean seems rather routine done pregnant women entering hospital connection birth yes would nt routinely show something like apply special routine today world drug use common doctor might need know look child well let ask reference question justice breyer thought correct wrong district court found hospital personnel conducted urine drug screens medical purposes wholly independent intent aid law enforcement efforts determined invalid finding finding district court conducted medical purposes independent intent aid law enforcement suppose arrests turned information social services department people act counselors women receiving public assistance would involved fourth amendment violation view ms ms smith go ms ms ms smith wish would clarify one point gotten terribly confused thought said thing wrong program driven means police using apprehend people engaged criminal conduct said answer question thought doctor testing drugs know treat woman child okay doctors took test gave social service people okay okay nt think go back qualify unless mean thought started said program driven police way getting people taken drugs one thing thought said makes infects whole thing nt police driving would okay medical purposes social welfare purposes position dss dss civil purposes well let put another hypothetical many states maybe states require physicians treating someone find indication criminal activity ca nt get treated gunshot wound example without reported reported police differ let assume routine urinalyses pregnant women sure nt drugs would make delivery difficult possibly hurt child find drugs someone allowed report police nt understand make different nt everybody okay criteria would criteria would determine whether likely woman endangering health health child criteria different well nt criteria different would reasonable criteria determine whether woman risk drug use endangering fetus drug nt well nt put woman child greater risk inadequate prenatal care mean drug use would dangerous woman child hospital knows operating area lot drug use says matter sound policy going test patients come high percentage nt want take chance urinalyses anyway going add drug use done medical purposes hospital concerned high incidence drug use community know know hard tell nt sure able treat woman child properly going give urinalysis everyone comes drug use police approach hospital hospital approach police set program initiative came hospital police nt show hospital one day say know like find way bust patients somehow doctors concerned problem drug use pregnant women well ms vehicle discovery urine sample suppose decide urine sample could look different things different say made special search kind thing determine anything urine sample make special search nt complaint done drugs use discovery would used arrest gathered previous answers questions objecting test drugs something highly specialized raised flag used connection desire bring law enforcement play object well know take urine specimen think physicians look number things urine specimen one requires specific procedure nt think looking drugs requires different sort procedure look number things urine sample thought could use urine sample test number things sample one would mean far procedure well ms ms smith mister mr hood hear thank ms ms case submitted ms ms smith respect first reasons point quite true sense law enforcement component whole scheme necessary success think success using success getting people drug treatment counseling program finishing whatever course counseling understand nt special need independent sense treating physicians need know regardless whether anyone takes counseling simply need know whether drug use involved affects risks mother risks fetus things need provide question even assumed law enforcement component counseling scheme would nt special need know fact nt demonstrate law enforcement component even added mix right yes well grant treating physicians special need guess get people drug treatment programs necessarily special need discover facts fact get evidence ultimately turned police correct nt well nt maybe wrong nt routinely well saying nt arrangement law enforcement hospitals saying hospitals matter course ignored possibility reason suspect ignored possibility drug use among pregnant women well right arrest leverage doctor understand doctor acting without prearrangement police said think reason worry drug use patient test urine see indication drug use hospital done found indication take judgment would constitutional problem called police said evidence patient x using counsel trial level nt ever ask finding court jury criteria used determine urine test would made urine samples criterion medically appropriate nt finding court implication jury verdict one way take formality prearrangement agreement police result would different case words made phone call police nt said yeah way maintain chain custody reasoning would constitutional violation case okay simply agreement makes difference constitutionality mean understand maybe misunderstood answer justice ginsburg minute ago said many words police component scheme taints understood least imply sort point getting question finding reason assume criteria taking samples testing samples criteria medically appropriate maybe used think assume case comes us present argument reasons hospital used determining sample would taken criteria testing sample drug presence medically appropriate criteria say many words police component scheme taints mean say part determination whether test modified medically appropriate set criteria least partial law enforcement set criteria argument wait want understand yes argument saying doctor become police agent doctor must treated police okay could doctor today thinks pregnant woman thinks woman taking drugs doctors wo nt look urine see taking drugs well nt know routine matter problem came told side doctors normally test pregnant women drugs would sound okay moreover told normally nt think woman taking drugs pregnant would sound right mean supposed looking health mother baby criminal sanction makes thought case would like know response justice scalia question question understood better repeating question thought wo nt resist chance question took normal thing believe medical world least psychiatric social workers doctors told medical examination discover patient going hurt person killing know going kill teller planning robbery obligation tell police course relevant side saying happening learning woman put viable fetus person risk right children born serious risk nt apply think fair roughly question nt apply hard figure mean leverage point imagine community high incidence tuberculosis anything wrong doctors saying know going regularly test pregnant women see feel nt know consent separate issue suppose doctors normally get consent test anyway fine right suppose tuberculosis simply drug use follow testing woman tuberculosis okay right drug use right doctor discovers course test person commit crime report police right right far road give test discover result report police saying okay something saying okay different case conclusions want know different happened world different said give test discover drug use report police may ask ms ms smith program instituted hospital hospitals city charleston follow yes could extend policy hospitals ever effort made extend policy hospitals explanation individualized suspicion help cases like sitz roadblock case one rationales sustaining random work ways randomness individualized search seems policy testing everyone see need counseling perhaps sustainable individualized suspicion argument making us would sustainable everybody well mean would say individualized suspicion helps hurts arguing moment ago individual suspicion makes suspect telling would better without well need know appropriate policy hospital use everybody individualized suspicion two nt know latter nt make defensible former okay laughter laughter okay okay thought
