seems strange party apply permit ground nt need permit apply permit army corps engineers going decide whether whether wetlands nt presupposed applying permit need one wetlands given given rather vague nature test adopted determining whether something part waters united states would nt difficult time showing determination arbitrary capricious would review going back justice kagan question let assume went apa apa process found wetlands compliance terms substantial nexus happens go enforcement action anything get estoppel anything get estoppel assuming legal question would factual findings substantial nexus remedy ordered violation would get estoppel conceding compliance order assuming violation right challenging terms compliance order finding violation court appeals say would independent liability violation compliance order unless violation statute would penalty violations compliance order kind review seeking mean one thing could say dispute property subject act might question reviewable seek seek review stage anything whether property subject act would standard called apa apa review epa epa acted reasonably determining wetlands limitation compliance order forever epa epa decides bring enforcement action asked earlier apa apa review would question determination wetlands said would answered another question would suggest may wetlands nt allowed build home anyway course would daily fine without compliance order would nt indeed violation act seems another distinction significant one routine inspections fire marshals restaurant inspectors disobey order subjected substantial liability would subjected issued order nt order produces new fine care mean fines nt nt argue wrestle difficult situation fines conceded fines nt know sufficient unto day evil thereof nt consider difficult cases understand get review applying afterthefact permit corps expense would incur order get would fill order requires something like twentyseven thousand five hundred dollars hard hard hit lot less know thirtyseven point five day well challenge compliance order simply nt wetlands jurisdiction epa epa surely raised corps engineers long take get one afterthefact permits issue permits wetlands thought permit allowing something wetlands otherwise would would allowed decide wetland nothing well wait wait surely would nt go try fight arbitrary capricious arbitrary capricious otherwise violation law would nt go say violation law nt think one standard review would much good tell truth thought maybe got wrong say arbitrary capricious going lose would nt problem procedure employed prior compliance order issues actual suit epa epa hold liable violating act one one suit issue would clear burden agency sustain really dual nature process creates difficulty nt statute agency nt make right statute provides compliance orders calls compliance orders nt course know going woods even get apa apa review okay factual questions go whether wetlands going decided giving substantial deference agency determination facts right even lose might still think win epa epa finally brings civil action seeking impose penalty burden epa epa without without deference factfinding still wo nt know lost one may win roll dice yes maybe agency entitled deference fact made record nt made record maybe reason give deference issue warnings mister mr schiff understanding day clients subject thirtyseven thousand five hundred dollars fines violation statute additional thirtyseven point five violation compliance order way understand penalty scheme work critical mister mr schiff true could go even compliance order property get adjudication whether wetlands context afterthefact permit proceeding would sufficient matter getting review question care question whether wetlands property said nt wetlands property permit problems finished mister mr schiff way see operating bring action contesting basis arbitrary capricious clause otherwise accordance law court rules continue fail comply epa epa bring separate enforcement action go back chief justice chief justice suggestion would preclusion agree mister mr schiff take government agrees much chance could get afterthefact permit view gotten beforethefact permit putting aside weirdness justice scalia points making go get permit something nt think need permit putting aside could nt gotten legal determination wanted process well think epa epa saying long knew lands potentially wetlands could gone getgo sought determination wetlands permit process actually see point better think worried worried get judicial review kind order court nt refer factfinding nt made record substantial evidence test applies factfinding made record five fiftysix five fiftyseven hard time harder time cases subjecting judicial factfinding think purpose purpose procedure given statute call shots favor might thousands things ca nt prepare formal thing see understand concern saying right understand concern want comment way accommodate concern also accommodates judicial review kind hobson choice sense want power thousands things investigate find facts think sufficient judicial factfinding carried judge nt experience et cetera therefore risk incorrect decisionmaking least two statute would prohomeowner rather proenvironment dilemma thought well might might change system win provide various kinds preorder procedure postorder procedure would open change see number possibilities tell would scope holding would would could write opinion court part case would rule mean health inspectors go restaurants time say unless fix going give citation fire inspectors thing wondering general theory general principle want us adopt would fit rather routine type enforcement well apa apa apa apa prong argument apply compliance order would automatically vacated mean nt compliance order presume wetlands nt agency already made determination wrong finding apa apa process wetlands end within context review say well wetlands minor extent conditions onerous far necessary protect wetlands argue apa apa review wetlands lose wetlands win cases courts appeals district courts landowners received notices compliance orders said taking property inverse condemnation sanction imposed day thirtyseven thousand dollars ten dollars nt comply know bring action time enforce subject statutory maximum period additional sanction administrative order compliance order ten dollars day might go adequacy judicial review adequacy judicial review would come apa apa brings enforcement action understood argument significant extortion impact fact significant fines doubled say could rack five years ten dollars day takes lot wind sails nt could nt understand exactly might get army corps engineers obviously might give permit take cuts liability hoping might say nt get permit wetlands something middle kind hard us tell would collateral estoppel apply judicial determination compliance order subsequent enforcement action words lose seek apa apa review court says think wetland epa epa brings enforcement action establish wetland nt attach copy decision guess back justice scalia question struck purely legal jurisdictional issue wetlands nt know give deference agency determination legal jurisdictional issue like thank counsel mister mr stewart thank counsel counsel case submitted
