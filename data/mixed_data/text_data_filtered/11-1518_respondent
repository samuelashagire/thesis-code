could go back tell yet give limiting principle sure applies seem saying agree petitioner law enforcement officer includes correction officers powers different civil area similar powers arrest search seize customs agents problem park employees think officers meet parks guarding parks may also giving tours usually sort mixture duties let assume adopted definition justice scalia proposed law enforcement officer engaged law enforcement activities would correction officers engaged law enforcement activities well look ways correction officers officers protecting securing prisoners acting law enforcement capacity forget act tort commit function okay sorry corrections officer act committed alleged sexual act nobody could except definition state law think ever happens naturally course intentional assault definition crimes covered assumes act licensed nt correction officer acting law enforcement capacity restraining people securing well happens happens police precinct police officers holding pretrial detainees acting police officers security people even prisoner comes back court court appearance us us marshals guard rather correction officers serving mind one advantage definition takes us workplace fights two employees presumably officers punch incident occurs nt acting law enforcement capacity assuming part argument well right goes back question asked one adversaries depends broadly narrowly define law enforcement activities take broadly government suggesting moments would could well say right law enforcement activity narrowly would would include securing detaining people securing detaining people would include park service person stops visitor punches would include military personnel stops someone intentional tort even though may walking grounds rather serving security particular day point give narrow reading giving broader reading government seems suggesting difference officer punches prisoner get ground pick would apply officer files arrest complaint prisoner security officer merely carries back cell physical injury substantial intentional assault gets treated exception security officer actually files arrest complaint would yes mister mr yang even depends state law clear united states sometimes concede scope authority represent sole defendant case individual officer hook united states could make argument never happened officer nt plaintiff charged may ask light opening statement abandoning position must either arrest search seizure used ninth circuit formula limitation scope limitation thought nt question scope limitation conduct covered right takedown occurred uncommon definition includes three things arrest search seizure correctional officers engage searches cells contraband engage seizures nt like arrest point arrest unusual escapee visitor true search seizure scope becomes kind surplusage law enforcement function give give example case scope would also relevant would also applicable law enforcement function fits scope add mister mr yang united states nt take position right change heart long ago united states took opposite position position argued amicus could nt obvious guess suggest congress might left libel slander misrepresentation would leave looking office function person performing right mean point saying suggests mean federal law enforcement officers engaged law enforcement well nt think epa epa engaged law enforcement enforces statutes regulations would officer epa epa law enforcement officer writes letter company saying know violating section suchandsuch statute law enforcement officer saying government trying minimize consequences coming way providing definition officers covered hold think cover broader category officers including osha osha inspectors cover engaged law enforcement activities kinds things mister mr yang would within scope employment would acting within law enforcement capacity law enforcement officer difference two standards law enforcement officer ca nt give couple examples difference would matter know states something would would meet scope employment test meet acting law enforcement officer test law enforcement officer mister mr bucholtz statute kind conductbased limitation says law enforcement officers acting within scope employment guess question given conductbased limitation statute one would substitute law enforcement officers acting law enforcement officers would nt one use conductbased limitation already acts law enforcement officers acts law enforcement officers acting within scope authority saying acting law enforcement officer mean one question suppose question gave mister mr yang difference two things guess second question would substitute one phrase acting phrase congress actually used mister mr bucholtz sure done already apologize could state definition means acting law enforcement officer activities three listed get included nt else gets mix would define generally maybe mean yes going adopt definition understanding taking us leave leave theory policeman law enforcement officer job nt law enforcement role oh see idea park policeman engaged law enforcement time engaged giving tours rest time saying would say engaged law enforcement covered engaged tour well nt nt prison guard law enforcement mean law says people going locked enforcing going prison da da da da da know da da da means conditions prison et cetera regulations rules statutes enforcing well saying three things could provide definition saying yeah epa epa thinking nt think thinking police okay one basic job policeman patrol arresting people searching seizing evidence patrol basically right law enforcement activity yeah yeah yeah mean places federal understand sure find analogies federal situation ordinary policemen right fbi fbi agents federal police people federal enclaves example federal enclaves act like policemen okay okay fair mean thinking either broad definition one going get trouble consider real policemen broad one nt see prison guards get narrow one guess could find lots federal policemen really policemen nt falls falls outside narrow definition wish could think better examples came ones think true strong textual argument position let ask studies statistics look see predictive matter many prison suits government ruling propose would would cause seems close two hundred thousand federal prisoners think prison work lot shoving guards break fights going number instances question guard overreach make assumption assumption nt looked statistics going vastly expand number cases government defendant nt bear likelihood congressional intent adopt position okay take theory track statute show theory works opening argument going argument help case prisoner prisoner supposed back cell block six oclock evening nt recreation yard somewhat recalcitrant two guards carry back cell block arrest well violating prison regulations law enforcement function contemplated statute view
