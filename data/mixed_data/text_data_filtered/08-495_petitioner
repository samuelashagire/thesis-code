extend lifeline government nt conceding amount loss element offense nt conceding necessary loss amount element offense well let give concrete example let say federal mail fraud case let say two federal mail fraud cases nt prove amount loss order convict mail fraud statute first case jury returns guilty verdict also return together answer special interrogatory say loss exceeded ten thousand dollars second case defendant pleads guilty admits plea colloquy amount ten thousand dollars would problem cases difference defendant saying guilty plea colloquy loss admit loss ten thousand dollars defendant agreeing sentencing purposes loss ten thousand dollars authority idea trial judge criminal case ask jury answer special interrogatory regarding question bearing conviction may bearing future immigration status defendant suggesting done tax cases case many defendants alien jury given charge covers defendants charged crime many aliens judge would nt distinguish would relevant defendants aliens would consequences judge even question could asked judge judge takes position element crime therefore going charge going confuse jury saying defendants aliens find amount go talking coupled another provision offense described section twentyone seventytwo oh one title twentysix tax evasion revenue loss government exceeds ten thousand construction requirement convict someone tax evasion jury find deficiency deficiency amount deficiency amount deficiency jury find order find tax evasion deficiency find revenue loss government exceeds ten thousand dollars problem pattern point justice souter made take position number statutes mention amount element seems rhyme reason amount nt unequal results within federal system states think would make sense congress drawn line way state happens make fraud deceit amount treating people identical thing differently saying denying people commit identical theft deceit fraud treated differently depending whether statute convicted clause go back question nt think fully answered tax evasion situation tax person charged tax evasion goes trial convicted person would deportable understand reading jury asked determine amount deficiency know told admit plea stage going trial parallel provisions seems meant operate way mister mr moseley nt nt understand squeeze modified categorical approach seems deus ex machina intended blunt government argument statutes would covered nt see get word convicted convicted offense involving ten thousand dollars separate interrogatory jury though obligation order find guilty say much stole interrogatory jury says oh yes amount ten thousand dollars cause convicted convicted charged convicted elements offense whatever whatever judge chooses allow jury questioned earlier earlier assertion necessary would necessary get amount specified sentencing purposes simply true mean nt nt hold guidelines mandatory need jury determination said discretionary nt jury determination still sentence basis amount taken even though found jury hope rebuttal address argument deferring agency finding means usually save rebuttal come back deference point say relevant criminal conviction convicted criminally regardless read acknowledge nt nt element crime convicted criminally acknowledge nt show amount right well later criminal proceeding would prove undoubtedly later criminal proceeding administrative proceeding nt bia bia initially determine interpret language purposes deportation laws true interpretation placed upon statute bia bia would also interpretation necessary secure criminal conviction case mister mr moseley get help question really difficulty seems read text easy read one two ways involves fraud deceit loss victim fact exceeded ten thousand dollars case would lose could read say involves fraud deceit element crime victim victims exceeded loss ten thousand dollars would lose also element crime relying modified approach modified approach statute say statute nt say anything conviction timehonored timehonored approach jury verdict necessarily necessarily fact refer amount involved ten thousand dollars would part timehonored approach statute would fulfilled well connection point argument may little early talking statute like know either anecdotally experience written somewhere often juries give special verdicts actually applies second case hear well changed light apprendi experience nt know many features crime jury verdict would like know changed day age may reach talked statute see multiple defendants case defendants might say unnecessary inflammatory underscores fact frankly could nt understand government concession point thought offense illegal entry enter illegally deported defense original deportation flawed nt understand see see thank counsel mister mr gannon thank counsel case submitted another please well admitting standard evidence matter well saying admit degree preponderance evidence ten thousand saying period ten thousand burden proof standard proof nt matter definitively resolves admission understand facts case commenting answer justice alito question would seem answer question difference right really gets question going ask nt see modified categorical approach something could admit would sufficient understand argument part argument based sort standard grammatical construction saying definition term aggravated felony means offense emphasize restrictive nature clause involves fraud deceit loss exceeds ten thousand dollars understand restrictive clause argument definition offense got include element exceeding ten thousand dollars satisfy satisfy standard arguing based restrictive clause seems got go whole hog get nothing whole hog got element offense loss exceed ten thousand dollars wrong okay one arguing based statute make argument based restrictive nature modifying clause going make restrictive clause argument seems got go whole hog say element offense got include loss excess ten thousand dollars well yeah would prevail would prevail seems expense objection government makes fraud deceit statutes define offense reference loss excess ten thousand dollars recollection government brief come three fact also provision ten thousand dollars figure placed statute time congress trying expand category deportable removable offenses would passing strange context define offense reference ten thousand dollars figure element offense would cut would cut compass statute three offenses response well get state statutes get problem utter would suppose unjust patchwork statutory reference would apply steal eleven thousand dollars state get booted country steal across state line state b stay home mean ca nt imagine congress would enacted kind scheme uniform test produces unjust results would suppose strangely unsatisfying results congress wanted expand concept deportable offense
