well allocation happening well envision happening parties ca nt state recipient medicaid assistance ca nt come agreement basically make estimate damages would case tried determine medical portion damages would fifteen percent reduce take amount settlement amount settlement attributable medical expenses fifteen percent would would envision correct seems seems really complicated judge case settled judge nt really know anything proof judge going position really could ask question different point could suppose north carolina legislature passed statute says something like following tort action item damages sought medical expenses plaintiff may recover item damages full amount medical expenses satisfied restructuring tort law would problem federal law federal law require client seek compensation medical expenses could could filed suit disclaimed claim medical expenses want compensated things sixteen already know going subject hearing nt reach agreement inducement state nt told come ignored states states know going increase potentially costs come often counsel judges nonmedicaid cases regularly let deal appears many colleagues gut instinct okay costs much burdensome already answered end nt believe could ever figure number really bottom line number artificial matter might well throw label reasonable leave alone answer argument essence belief bottom line allocation always going wrong somehow counsel proceedings witnesses called usually done papers could move microphone little closer thank ms ms anders could please finish response said various states various things could describe many states north carolina rule know happens said north carolina workers compensation settlements subject workers compensation liens type system work workers compensation recoveries thing owe state medical agree agree flaw north carolina statute fixed amount rebuttable presumption would okay north carolina law says thirty percent cap particular case show fair allocation yes nt answer question mean portion according north carolina onethird yes state says law mean state says onethird medical need ultimately need adjudication leave either jury decide percentage total award medical expenses separate proceeding let say settlement need separate proceeding decide much really medical know may say ten percent believes need proceeding awfully timeconsuming justice kagan suggests sure going accurate nt think jury determination going going accurate score nt know go determining much settlement attributable medical expenses versus things especially settlement says ten percent medical expenses nt understand adjudicate issue adjudication much award allocated medical expenses much award fact allocated medical expenses issue seems latter nt right much allocated right nt matter ought issue proportion parties fact allocate medical expenses right say one penny going contradict know putting putting discretion court say done workmen compensation quite different proposing seems quite workable know court hears evidence decides much reimbursed within within court discretion asking court decide much recovery much settlement attributable medical portion totally different question would defendant jiggering system mean suing medical portion simply defendant knows least portion would would go would go state situation total recovery going suffice cover pain suffering medical expenses intelligent justice alito proposed seems real nt know gaming gaming system excuse theoretical problem right outset mean statute forbids asserting lien recovery medical expenses telling states nt even trying find portion recovery medical expenses looking determine proportion medical expenses tie prohibition lien saying state making determination fact take away plaintiff recovered greater amount medical expenses lesser amount medical expenses take take away determining much allocated medical expenses right messing lien law anyway matter way play sure hhs hhs authority state recovers nt see part administration statute committed hhs hhs know admire citing chevron mister mr browning let give different rationale statute different one state suggests would go something like allocation made making allocations two ways casebycase individualized decisionmaking use brightline rules advantage brightline rules cheap efficient sometimes inaccurate individualized decisionmaking individualized decisionmaking maker errors reasonable way make allocation decision nothing said ahlborn suggests state needs use caseby case decisionmaking rather brightline rules make allocation needs make medical nonmedical damages rebuttal presumption states sides come try rebut individual beneficiary try rebut states could well right beneficiary try rebut presumption work would imagine negotiation victim lawyer tortfeasor lawyer tortfeasor lawyer interested bottom line number low possible victim number high possible victim lawyer fact would like little possible allocated source going take money away reach agreement say one penny medical expenses everything else pain suffering good victim irrelevant tortfeasor see piece paper going kind proceeding going proceeding proceeding proceeding settlement negotiation going look like look like sixteen states plaintiff lawyer testify say honor really wanted one penny one penny allocated pain medical expense defendant lawyer honest say nt care wants fine exactly look like point work states asking question sixteen states procedure work nt want know want know works put problem seems might work well would like tell us really works satisfied presumption law gives legup mean like chevron skidmore something like know position question law mean decide case see reasonable point reasonable point points reasonable get benefit kind legal presumption like chevron skidmore et cetera maybe think another one nt know nt nt missing part maybe missed interpreting statute part trumps lien provision part says state entitled payment made medical assistance health care items similar language statute think onethird rule good way measuring think onethird rule rebuttable presumption better way measuring normally often would see government arguments like say way interpreting technical language statute chevron skidmore means give us particular weight part argument nt nt impression get chevron deference basis whether congress lot rules forth nt claimed puzzles nt argue want argue awfully technical language minor interstitial claim well worse care smaller amount means victim going actually get keep victim lawyer concerned fine tortfeasor lawyer otherwise would pay sorry point fair exactly going say know fair appropriate come let say twenty thousand dollars medical expenses claim pain suffering come recover million dollars right appropriate case side say well settled million dollars pain suffering really twenty million came million fair allocation case medical expenses seems entirely artificial judgment extent depends views two parties negotiating thought established entirely subject manipulation little better go ahead answer laughter said several times way based judge experience cases think friend side saying pretty much going except time mean would right time judge says well typically sometimes twentyfive percent sometimes thirtyfive percent time sort thirtythree percent going absolute rule nt go proceedings every time make sure thirty percent rather thirtythree percent guess justice kagan question wrong brightline rule well dealing north carolina statute nt get deference along lines well ca nt clear cms cms took opposite position case right thank counsel ms ms anders yes thanks reasonable federal district court state procedure parties guess coming saying well juries work nt care measure damages particularly calculable come general view got medical expenses got pain suffering make judgment would good argument make would take account said well medical expenses readily calculable assume jury meant first stuff extra state get maybe sometimes come total figure nt care allocated say well argument make well judge supposed particular case real significant increase burden state medicaid program saying yes try recover recovery thirdparty tortfeasors got set apparatus everybody come got prove allocation mean thirtyfour states nt done right well yes purposes interested purposes trying figure whether significant financial burden state going go trying recover money got provide apparatus administrative judicial whatever make calculation still nt understand addressed even know addressed take account things come equitable thank counsel general maddrey three minutes remaining
