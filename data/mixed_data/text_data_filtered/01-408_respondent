ms ms pryor time limit pick mean suppose person disability indeed expected last twelve months caused black incapable working one minute one minute blackout entitle come program right week excuse nt hear time five month entire five months disability must must continue establishes establishes five months section four twentythree reading sixtyfour part page part page sixtyfive thank would sixth month every time started month six let take case man engage substantial gainful activity two years right starts six months disabled continues nine months case starts month six many months actually would getting disability benefits could give time frame know starting start april end minimum end would considerable time restored substantial gainful activity period making substantial gainful activity even though say impairment continued would disabled basic statutory problem think see debating whether become entitled five months twelve months seems turn language seventy government reading basically many ways reading say disability inability reason engage substantial gainful activity reason impairment expected result death lasted know expected result death lasted expected last point read words level severity problem absolutely frank think could read level severity nt read level severity government social security administration read government way forty years nobody done thing indeed congress passed laws seem think right would major change jump twelve months five months response time laughter language course ca nt read ca nt statute refers bear ca nt call fish statute refers animal certainly read nt mean fleas mean common statute nt say level severity nt say make assumption ms ms pryor think heard ms ms pryor asked mister mr lamken saying effect word impairment means disabling impairment think would agree condition severely disabled one week excruciating back pain could nt anything impairment continued less severe level well beyond year nt impede substantial gainful activity would disabled yet read statute literally would case gave says condition disabling severe short period time twelve months nt matter level severity five months must unable engage substantial gainful f talking section four twentythree f page reading reading copy laughter page seventysix says person getting benefits may determined entitled benefits basis finding physical mental impairment basis benefits provided ceased exist disabling finding supported go three substantial evidence demonstrates determined basis new improved diagnostic techniques individual impairment combination impairments disabling considered time recent prior decision disability therefore individual able engage substantial gainful activity seems imply disability consists continuous inability engage substantial gainful activity sporadic one yes requires therefore individual able engage substantial gainful activity implies long engage substantial gainful activity would nt matter disabled sporadically day day implies continuous inability engage substantial gainful activity understand understand refers termination would apply termination gives indication initial condition expected namely condition continuous inability work yes say severity requirement nothing duration termination provision suggests something duration engage substantial gainful activity terminated assuming improvement condition think right guess nt get one week five month period person goes back work would mean got benefits week test medical improvement would ability go back work could may also ask know think legally significant disagree government position consistently interpreted statute way forty years would agree correctly describe legislative deliberations nineteen fiftysix think say totally irrelevant one thing wonder case like point raised litigants client trial work period mean twelve months versus five months anyone argued case refers question two right question two understand correctly substantial agreement courts appeals correct case question one well question two hinges question lose question one lose question two nt agree government estimate win case difference payouts program going something like dollar eight billion year excessive ask ask quickly simply repeating question two right thinking nt reach question two lose question one asked nt understand thought maybe answered would reach entitled lose question one person never became entitled social security statute says period trial work shall begin month becomes entitled social security exactly maybe nt mean repeat missed response nt understand lose question one client therefore entitled social security nt end case nt reach question two yes well lose question one nt disability going going write somebody going write suppose first conclusion client never became entitled social security never lot different reasons suppose every one rejected maybe would nt assume reach question two yes never entitled right decide whatever theories may whether entitled oh yes course could turn client even though nt disabled level severity twelve months nonetheless person decided guess person could eight months decider could said oh expected last level severity well guess take position nt decided statute says person entitled end five months position nt require decision maker determine fact disability level must government claims case determination made twelve month period time person back working substantial level determination properly made person never qualified would reason case like ever proceed second question nt correct okay may ask one question want sure nt missed something argument agree understand severity requirement impairment severity requirement understand saying severity requirement inability engage substantial work seems really trouble understanding severity requirement measured inability work period time severity requirement would nt continue entire period statutory definition impairment trouble understanding nt say disability durational requirement disability unless severe enough impairment say record tell us happened respondent interim thank ms ms pryor mister mr lamken
