considering government second chance trimmed five twenty insider trading new indictment five ninetynine counts laundering trimmed eight something within jury ken nt likely thing case jury simply exhausted well qualify statement facts insider information relation insider information charges different respect insider information connection substantive charge answer question exactly justice stevens said could inconsistent verdicts powell well ca nt since hung could nt try hung count answer trying briefs way answer look see policies underlie collateral estoppel part double jeopardy apply ca nt think one nt ca nt think one single one would nt apply maybe ca nt think reason allowing government second bite apple reason course nt course nt suppose never brought hung count would nt even first bite apple would think would fortiori could go ahead case clearly ca nt go ahead nt think anything integrity anything thought tried time test mind imagine february try individual drug count acquitted june bring telephone count absolutely forbidden right okay government one whit better addition happened bring telephone count january along start side think justice stevens suggesting assume one trial substantive count january decide acquitted decide indict july telephone count argue judge judge nt double jeopardy maybe jury acquitted first time lenient maybe liked looks maybe distracted fly maybe maybe nt even get appeal going win case even close okay even close since going lose case grant thousands cases talking ability bring cases hung jury concede none talks double jeopardy knowledge back hypothetical lost case turn case winning case also indicted telephone count january question first time began two answers nt see government better also indicted january given language double jeopardy might think government anything worse let keep neutral reason government worse indicted january telephone count well june better misspoke well successive prosecution sense indictment took place acquittal nt difference fact first case conflicting simultaneous verdict one explain acquittal grounds leniency compromise something like says therefore give effect conviction simultaneous reasons may irrationality conflict reason doubt validity acquittal case time one fifty counts entirely possible nt reach decision case conflict guilty innocent verdict nt reason doubt integrity acquittal reason doubts integrity acquittal probably compromised say tough sequential prosecutions reason question integrity acquittal case key argument government entitled one full fair opportunity try case opportunity first time around separate counts would would fair would end matter right retry position would brought first proceeding brought first proceeding case would barred oh dunn doctrine questionable basically says certain situation tolerate may irrational verdict reason tolerate acquittal may explained grounds namely whole whole doctrine inconsistent verdicts depends assumption appears irrational inconsistency may another explanation one hung jury followed second acquittal first time around customary difference first trial impugning integrity jury verdict following acquittal true compromise cases dunn case cases case talking two different juries saying second jury opportunity correct first jury even though would opportunity first jury faced issue nt know know reach conclusion issue reach conclusion count acquitted make presumption inconsistent verdict say even irrational go along one jury may non unsound legal reasons saying well let guy one count jury take irrational action case action relevant acquittal nt act would irrational returned verdict said ca nt agree knows clear argue court district court correct analyzing estoppel issue obviously difficult issue judges disagreed government opponent disagree entirely possible jury nt able figure jury could confused court appeals well first theory theory retrial hung counts always permitted take court appeals opinions decisions agree point incorrect different question suppose prevail hung counts retried jury hangs jury hangs second time point district court intervene exercise authority discretion dismiss charges government try year year get conviction wear defendant nothing court long hung jury rule states nt states give authority judges say enough enough asking us pretty dramatic extension powell powell case involving subsequent prosecutions well proceeding two different jury verdicts one going way one obviously one way one way protect jury conclusions could nt give effect one without undermining different case jury determination acquittal give effect nt give effect findings acquittal undermining jury determination jury well point big extension rather coy brief think ashe v asking us revisit well going talk going talk text double jeopardy clause rely case pretty easy nt person jeopardy hung offense well court decisions text double jeopardy clause think right argument depends upon interest balancing interest giving effect acquittal verdict think seventh amendment important protecting jury verdicts interest irrational case conviction acquittal two jury verdicts ca nt go one way without undermining one however give full effect verdict acquittal without undermining another jury verdict certainly undermine government interest prosecuting hung jury think important seventh amendment jury verdicts case comes way right well carried burden court appeals revisiting issue included within question presented agree proposition conflict granted cert resolve would still continue theory depends upon viewing hung jury constituting action jury obviously sense view accept proposition juries act returning verdicts reason retry hung jury jury nt really done anything way jurors act case comes defendant prevails right yes thank counsel mister mr buffone six minutes remaining nt nt real problem raised answer following problem age justice breyer hypo suggests lots overlapping criminal statutes indict drugs telephones nt know overlapping crimes may therefore gives government joining lot overlapping charges lots charges common elements either one indictment various counts simply series indictments tried together gives government bigger chance getting hung jury irrational resolution issues government bring loads counts increase likelihood getting hung jury one issue one indictment government effect key avoiding justice breyer hypothetical suggested wait bring second count june issue preclusion bring together got irrational verdict issue preclusion therefore nt policy behind double jeopardy issue preclusion extension policy argues favor saying nt let government bites apple fact results result seriatim prosecutions response argument government ask something one fair chance comes one seventeen counts maybe fair chance consists fair chance number counts number indictments one reasonably expect jury handle without either getting totally confused totally exhausted oh right making argument make
