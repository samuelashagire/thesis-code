postcontract claim would nt wrong whether retaliation claim nt know give deference one point proven wrong one little complicated inferred cause action bad old days inferring causes action place position government takes infer new cause action assist one already books government going consistent position want us future go back prior practice readily inferring causes action set forth text statute government willing live patterson still bad old days think bad old days ended laughter oh sorry thinking sullivan would tougher court make argument inferring cause action period nt know whether would tougher court make argument cause action got include point moment ago rationale cases important get right rationale say wrong tell wrong thought heart retaliated act retaliation discrimination nt say white man helps black man discriminated falls within statute discriminated black man nt fall within statute would seriously erode destroy black man right seemed douglas said sullivan looking hard place word could nt well say clear neither government seems tell words statute argument create cause action order make effective understand argument think court cases stand want seems admitting nothing words statute amended help government well impairment think quite wrong section c almost admission government part ca nt find words section b time patterson congress nothing amendment help case patterson retaliation case patterson discharge harassment case words seem cover nothing argued far shows words statute amended say new subsection b read subsection c mean argue think talk b still want know particular words section b benefit privilege ironic say cases wrong congress agreed disagreed patterson true sullivan property owner wants sell particularly advantageous position enforce rights buyer part contract extend situation quite extension sullivan view taking away argument write opinion favor would say necessary imply cause action prohibiting retaliation order make words effective seems limited argument difficult argument prevail upon given authorities approach court discussed understand certainly cause action terms contract want add add new term ca nt use existing terms say cause action helps client general approach protection postcontract formation would agree nt think get impairment making enforcement patterson talking make enforce brings us right back started asking us infer find implied words cause action retaliation words words statute impairment nt agree government third reason word nt statute well benefit privilege term contract fairly

question asked friend ask well think case sullivan recognized although nineteen eightytwo type action sullivan would come way today given alexander sandoval new approach statutory interpretation concerned stare decisis body law give effect sullivan case recent cases read statutes course nineteen ninetyone new approach reading statutes pretty clearly established congress looking bodies law would nt normal care put retaliation provision extent argument relies heavily sullivan went back read rather implied right action case looked like third party standing case think right get back another stare decisis question rely sullivan actually said rely jackson reinterpretation sullivan agree though language opinion focuses third party standing question thank counsel general clement employer fires everybody complains practices work would covered retaliation think unusual employers practice anybody alleges committed violation federal law want get rid nt doubt sullivan would come
