draw distinction mister mr salinas situation someone questioned home person home street person person totally unknown police called police said want wants talk purpose would nt draw distinction situation wants talk wants talk course conversation thing happens happened unless going argue silence never commented noncustodial situation nt think willing go far questioning previously going kind linedrawing questions nt held nature initiated person really suspicion purpose questioning mister mr fisher number problems first rule would seen giving noncustodial defendants rights defendants custody arguing think greater degree expression silence would needed show invocation privilege selfincrimination trying equate rights defendant custodial noncustodial respect invocation problem easier problem understanding argument respect going ask adversaries respect situation someone approached police said come talk us hard time understanding refusal come talk could held understand defendant went talked chose get rights berghuis remained silent two one half hours court nt willing find invocation privilege selfincrimination would find refusal ask one answer one question indicative privilege silence privilege silence would deal another comment situation defendant meets police gives story later changes story question asked trial never volunteered story police questioned would silence would invocation right incriminate would would prosecutor barred arguing jury often done chose say madeup story though sometimes come back later different confession assuming thinking argument would argue even custodial setting prosecutor could nt say asked shoot wife prosecutor ca nt argue refused answer makes guilty well fact trials district court judges tell juries evidence unanswered question question plus answer guess understand rule sorry ask rebuttal like go back justice ginsburg argued argument nt invocation right physical conduct statement would problem prosecutor argued trial know asked testing nt remain silent got nervous shows guilt nt nt like berg berghuis case case someone given miranda warnings even court said silent nt invoke fifth amendment therefore silence commented mister mr fisher understand correctly saying demeanor different although impermissible comment silence okay say looked seemed sweating nervous shuffling feet nt nt point mister mr fisher question insufficient berghuis insufficient purpose cutting police questions case question whether sufficient insufficient purpose allowing statement silence used trial entirely different question nt law mean joe smith leaves blank part tax return irs irs gets later turns relevant prosecutor wants say hey left blank okay griffin nt apply right mean nt going say time refuse tell government anything later turns relevant criminal prosecution taken invocation fifth amendment mean want go far okay need line need line tax case case selling tickets policeman ball somebody comes door policeman says hey nt seen around nt answer okay probably invocation clear line custody want extend line want know follow extend line draw well yes doubt remaining silent issue whether trying raise fifth amendment right suppose rule whatever situation either individual expressly raises right least fair implication circumstance trying assert right would sensible rule would case stack depends circumstance yes well yes answer going yes going hear one minute say follows fortiori berghuis going make explicit statement invoke fifth amendment right inherently coercive setting mean going argument inherently coercive setting miranda situation trial outside two situations say explicitly invoking fifth amendment tap constitution something order indicate issue yes right saying line called custody line get outside custody well nt want make government argument make well think argument think least mind sitting fortyfive minutes maybe hour fortyfive minutes without saying anything maybe taking dissenting position answer nt answer long period time nt say want remain silent long period behavior insufficient without express statement show wanted remain silent outside custodial setting insufficient simply remain silent show see argument analogy think well well settled wherein examining witness takes suddenly says nt want questions waived court examining witness stand background suppose case facts said police said would matched shotgun shells said said well starts cry said one word well started cry admissible said well could police officer also testify started cry prosecution could say well said well started cry never told us anything else final sentence used impermissible nt want saying miranda warning required invoke fifth amendment mean understood know arguing well invoked might make big difference brief acknowledge citizens know fifth amendment right questions somehow troublesome say invoking fifth amendment right go away even custody even miranda nt apply client nt giving us miranda miranda custody custody gray area arguing want gray area opinion written custody let say answering questions sudden gets particular question says know getting late think done going go home invocation fifth amendment right well something something could used trial well probative says answering questions fine sudden say well shotgun going match shell goes gosh late going go home seems seems probative silence thank counsel mister mr curry thank counsel case submitted
