hazardous material maybe reasonable requirement appears minority view suggesting adopt well think adopt interpretation fela fela says verifiable causal nexus acknowledge view generally minority view country may make sense want know mister mr phillips know light second question nt even talked joint several nt sure support statute evidence trial apportionment made say case brought theory five seventythree jurisdictions go days require reasonable causal nexus thought well nt think emotional fear ought one reasonable causal nexus asbestosis fear nt mister mr phillips defendant attempt test seeking special verdict damages could broken jury general verdict nt know much gave anything could could tested isolated know much actually allocated whether initially said primary whether lesser thing nt know cause whole part could read say really question bear burden bringing people joint several could join people view say plaintiff unless plaintiff bring people get small piece particular one cases selfstanding claim emotional distress nt pinned existing injuries difference least portrayed judge made part pain suffering injury asbestosis one elements damages pain suffering included pain suffering least way judge saw distinguished buckley gottshall selfstanding claims emotional distress tied preexisting injury nt matter form familiar one cases question statute limitations start run get virulent form cancer begin run got asbestosis tipped sued answer context many courts say cancer separate claim necessarily context said brief question whether get cancer get cancer get damages past present future pain suffering quite right leaving category person asbestosis never gets cancer people people question whether right never never collect alleged fear mister mr mister mr lazarus may ask point let moment think lawyers two people person buckley snowman person asbestosis people may real fear cancer may find credible witnesses thought buckley situation one concern easy make people facing risk say well yeah might run tomorrow nt bother nt real problem fear something fear nt physical manifestation things easy make uncontrollable frankly ca nt see difference point view sufferer person buckley person person grand central station case could say fear person nt proved fear proved mine recover well legitimate doubt conditions people worked grand central station exposed asbestos told much earlier exposure must angry nt told well would nt error mean instruction say plaintiff demonstrated developed reasonable fear cancer related proven physical injury asbestos compensated fear instruction court says award damages cancer increased risk suppose take one plaintiff nervous apprehensive person increased risk right going much aggravated take another person subject risk thicker skin says well take stride person gets person gets cancer take agree government person could get past present future anxiety part pain suffering suppose person earlier asbestos brings claim lung cancer could nt prevail today defendant say well least apprehension past know precluded could brought claim got asbestosis would claim preclusion say burden conceded think said conceded conceded fear cancer emanate asbestosis clear greater risk cancer contracted asbestosis nt fear connected asbestosis mean unlimited damages nt know want us statistical chance getting cancer asbestosis chances doubled would enough create kind fear could allow damages ninety percent certain developed asbestosis develop cancer okay somewhere fifty ninety percent nt jury question know sure one lead respondents agree factual point asbestosis lead cancer rather produced cause produces cancer question nt put jury mean fact jury required find fear fear asbestosis would turn cancer nt understand saying allocate money still paid claimant person actually cancer comes court company bankrupt disproportionate mister mr phillips west virginia practice plaintiff defendant requests special verdict automatically allowed discretion trial court well mister mr phillips mister mr salmons hear thank mister mr salmons mister mr lazarus hear well question presented nt speak terms instruction read well mister mr lazarus put physician stand physician says man twentyfive years old injured ordinarily would expected live seventyfive result injury going live seventytwo sort thing compensable mister mr lazarus increased chance cancer asbestosis asbestosis originates exposure asbestos exposure asbestos asbestosis cause cancer well challenge statement opponents asbestosis change cancer well wait minute asked question answer challenge ask one nt automatic jurisdictions mister mr lazarus ca nt say want special verdict court says nt think give one pretty much end nt well know saying worked place highest concentrations far railroad concerned know compares worked elsewhere thank mister mr phillips case submitted ask questions causation theory espousing okay take argument mere fact association asbestosis higher risk developing cancer depending whether smoke enough association support effect separate element damages fear cancer authority words saying got kind different intense causal relationship simply association statistically shown basis asbestosis nt point proof asbestosis statistical showing nt deny think higher degree risk however causal chain works associates asbestosis fear cancer buckley situation question nt statistical association sufficient ground instruction allowing compensation fear results association well call disconnect calls connect take undenied statistical association asbestosis probability developing cancer basis claim fear inconsistent common law theory pain suffering damages right want use kind terminology nt see nt got reason people worried got asbestosis people asbestosis higher chance developing cancer nt enough saying even common law allowed allow act act nt allow okay got authority association two conditions insufficient support damage award got something got proof serious risk proof consists fact asbestosis fact developed know position cross threshold case threshold shows fear fact serious one least asbestosis developed nt fear cancer reasonable whether fear rests upon fact ten percent asbestosis cases asbestosis progresses cancer nt true hand percentage asbestosis cases cancer also develop result common cause employer liable fear less reasonable either cases well know one questions want know determining whether recovery possible whether fear reasonable one threshold test agree fear least got confirmed physical manifestation okay got physical manifestation shown reasonable fear reasonable fear enough recovery whether causal connection goes asbestosis cancer common cause cancer respect mister mr lazarus nt bottom line argument simply issue case nt provide basis saying forget nt really saying unless abuse discretion part trial judge refusing send jury based described insufficiency evidence part case us know mean notice awards seem grow age nt seem vary depending upon smoking mean inversely related age nt seem affected smoking suggested maybe nt play major part fear cancer know played major part would maybe entitled fear person problem world one four chance dying cancer person subjected asbestos may one three chance gives entitlement little amount anyway true say felt question open reason thought open probably learned area law arose english case somebody watching coffin fall accident rule ca nt recover unless something hits recovering coffin pain suffering family member would feel immediate directly related accident quite clearly present measurable kind thing immediate fear something way future hard determine whether right wrong causal relation physical thing therefore thought open want say look say absolutely open mean know lots briefs made pretty good case least open oh right mean saw reply brief reply briefed underlined phrase italicized phrase conduct causes really issue issue words called emotional disturbance question kind disturbance think argument put numbers one us room one four chance die cancer difference us plaintiff case one wait one five one five one four saying think difference one five chance dying cancer difference one four chance dying cancer intangible hard measure anyone psychology nobody really makes distinctions rational therefore nt open juries awarding large amounts money nt think evidence relevant would say question put us matter law us look numbers reaching numbers gave assumed everything favor really railroad kind thing involved studies cite could lot less say going think right dog bite cases support radiation cases support cutanddried say win look stuff come conclusion come conclusion nt cutanddried much sea want see one reason gave risk problems driving like comment concern begin compensate people fear small changes risks law nt open point happen asbestos cases initial point dollar two hundred billion stake fund run dry people really get cancer come court cupboard bare think serious policy problem worrying quite lot keep coming back open nature well say law yes well fact one element nt mean primary element suffer physical impairment result asbestosis know physical impairment primary ingredient jury verdict nt yes said primary element damages think justice breyer wondering whether record really supports ask may ask question really wanted ask mister mr phillips time running would draw distinction case asbestosis actually cause cancer opposed case like asbestos cancer asbestosis cancer result common cause would say case true understand asbestosis contributing cause cancer would liability taking things account case cancer result asbestosis rather result common source question causal correlation fifty percent people contracted asbestosis result exposure asbestos also contract cancer matter nt quite see understand think correctly state agree facts may ask one quick question agree mister mr phillips appraisal facts assume fear cancer major element may ask say evidence degree exposure areas forth nt make offers proof prove time worked well would question weight evidence rather whether preserved point pathways oh request instruction nt point preserved oh theory several liability would appropriate evidence fear going die cancer compensable get compensable get oh thought recover fear cases would discount right first answer changed cases law give discounts first verdict well indicates maybe recovery problematic let ask one please testimony plaintiff heavy severe asbestosis plaintiff b mild based lung xrays show person badly infected right since dependent dosage nt case apportion causation correct wrong principle tort law causation apportioned injury several liability tort wrong since asbestosis peculiarly related dosage exposure nt proper ground apportionment well relevant joint liability seems argument goes weight evidence offered rather legal position may missing something well proffer remember proffer evidence time people worked areas exposed asbestos nt saying enough well adopt position difficult show separate causation brother argues oh relevance think overall point mind side would say think say case impact result impact thickening lungs person fear getting cancer greater people entitles traditional law damages get special verdict easy see jury awarded much damage case get reversal get reversal get much problem anything six thousand plaintiffs enormous damage problems overall mister mr phillips look case one claim traditional pain suffering damages view well sounds like want us say limitation availability pain suffering damages context asbestosis case apportionment laughter going ask one prevail one plaintiffs develops cancer assume go sue right kind discount fear point trial become clear ruling trial judge could rely exposure areas well mister mr lazarus mister mr phillips
