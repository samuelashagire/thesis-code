provision would guide appellate review rehabilitation always factor court appeals determine whether judge abused discretion said five years guideline range presumably twentyfour months judge adds five years define simple answer judge imposing sentence rehabilitation ca nt arguing arguing except within range quite sure understand far going prisons multiple treatment programs vocational treatment relying fact supervised release term judge say man woman needs rehabilitation want program prison setting judge judge colloquy justice scalia showed judge wanted program never got judge control could follow argument much better judge could say specialized program making term incarceration disturbing factor argument judge recommend judge way making sure person prison longer get treatment judge wants judge ca nt control person serve sentence treatment available nt something responded nt said rather nt something placing facility another inmate nt involved would nt proposal lead unevenness sentencing right choice extending term accommodate drug program could judge would option think nearly half people incarcerated drug addiction one judge might say going let person least chance get program another say ca nt control going subject would introducing framers reform act trying get away swings one judge another dealing almost half prison population think say wrong district court whether established appeal wrong another matter nt understand saying seems statute requires consider rehabilitation imposing sentence right imposing imprisonment consider rehabilitation deciding person required probated term long going stay prison gets probation well would nt affect length sentence talking say judge prescribe incarcerated particular facility nt know consider solves case makes everything okay refused would able refuse made condition supervised release either take program go back jail mean insignificant difference fact judge control whether person gets rehabilitation supposedly purpose extended prison term makes sense responding point making different point saying help case reason get rehabilitative treatment judge wanted get simply refused help case could nt

rehabilitate laughter means judge power impose imprisonment empower impose anything else imprisonment mean saying might make sense indeed could prescribe treatment imprisonment ca nt prisons ca nt way prevented although allowed supervised release make sense indeed say take account imprisonment say congress leave bureau prisons decide whether person enter rehabilitation program allow judge prescribe person enter possible sense could make judges prescribe well substantive change ca nt prescribe right nt understand saying change judge could prescribe certain program prisoner change would change statute reads way say sense make still allow judge take account affirmatively deprive power wanted mister mr roberts could take back justice kennedy question start oneway ratchet government theory congress might thinking said ca nt think rehabilitation sentence lengthen sentence think rehabilitation make decision sentence shorten sentence would would congress mind counsel assume mister mr bibas say nt really understand whole premise argument basically saying judge consider rehabilitation judge consider educational programs vocational programs treatment programs forth think people would think things rehabilitation nothing left say judge consider things yes well ask question saying consider rehabilitation imposing sentence consider rehabilitation imposing sentence consider programs imposing sentence saying difference programs rehabilitation say consider programs left ca nt consider mister mr bibas practically speaking clause instruct court view well really thought nineteen eightyfour people talked rehabilitation talking drug programs talking education programs talking vocation programs talking idea passed away long since locking cell going rehabilitate well senate report says provisions talking make clear defendant sent prison prison program might good drug dependence committee view generally play role decision whether incarcerate offender something conflicts pretty clear indication committee view put great deal weight word guess dual motive nt really know would happened absence one motives send whole thing back resentencing suppose suppose case judge going sentence two years matter two year rehabilitation program defendant prisoner receiving would say point prisoner receiving imprisonment term rehabilitation hypothetical term nt affected program judge recommends program prisoner receiving would agree prisoner receiving imprisonment term rehabilitation use two goals sentencing conjunctive imprisonment rehabilitation time talking matter diction would agree instances hypothetical case receive imprisonment rehabilitation time talking statute says question indicates hypothetical indicates mutually exclusive imprisonment rehabilitation time case little different nt get let talk hypothetical suppose judge said going sentence twelve months particular facility drug treatment program really benefit safer citizen going mix imprisonment rehabilitation even going make going consider interested imprisonment abuse discretion failure consider factors congress set forth including rehabilitation said said going consider right right must consider rehabilitation context imprisonment seem principal trouble argument justice scalia mentioned judge ca nt certain treatment provided answer earlier question said well ninety percent time judge recommendation followed program offered suppose ten percent time suppose ten percent time could bureau prisons follow judge recommendation would nt interpretation statute difficult sustain still find hard going write opinion rule position ignore ninety percent ten percent hypothetical problem say well ninety percent time judge rules going followed judge recommendations going followed odd way support interpretation statute adopt order rule favor say suppose position recommendation followed ten percent time mister mr chief justice may please court section thirtyfive eightytwo well congress intending reject prevailing rehabilitation model sentencing model defendants kept prison declared rehabilitated based participation treatment programs congress determined coercing participation prison programs way nt failed rehabilitation could nt accomplished reliably prison setting well congress expressly determined retain people said rehabilitation never works ca nt legitimate purpose sentencing congress decided go far expressly retained rehabilitation purpose sentencing reflected section thirtyfive fiftythree congress determined could nt reliably induce prison nt appropriate deprive defendants liberty expend resources keeping prison purpose rehabilitation remained possibility forms sentencing appropriate ways attempt achieve rehabilitation congress expressly provided imposing sentence probation court require defendant participate particular treatment programs think would depend whether aggravating know mitigating circumstance guidelines nt adequately taken account nt think congress trying prevent court selecting another sentencing option probation lieu imprisonment court determined primary purpose sentence rehabilitation shorten sentence speed defendant imprisonment supervised release court could guarantee defendant would participate programs hand important important purposes protecting public deterring defendant committing crimes deterring generally court supposed sentence defendant prison accordance even defendant also needed rehabilitation well prisoner receiving imprisonment term think prisoner receiving rehabilitative services yes prison prison yes well congress intended even defendant needed rehabilitation goals sentencing deterrence protecting public justified term imprisonment court impose term imprisonment congress yes yes yes congress wanted courts required courts recognize imprisonment appropriate means promoting rehabilitation agree rehabilitative programs prison congress trying preclude imposing imprisonment purpose providing

two going pick one half right problem always depend judge says think generally take district court court word purposes sentence sentence justified reasons district court gives sentencing defendant judge yes mean nt know mean question know wrong wrong inside district court head district court actually recognizing rehabilitation appropriate means promoting imprisonment appropriate means promoting rehabilitation fact disingenuous court reason court violating statute going know defendant right raise arguments inquire every case say well say punish list ten cases think like case people got less think going hard defendant obtain reversal conviction circumstances well think going hard government defend sentence circumstances well think said words court required give reasons imposing sentence presume district courts honestly give reasons imposing sentence court indeed lengthening term imprisonment court wants defendant program court say judge moskowitz court makes clear imprisonment appropriate means promoting rehabilitation therefore courts impose lengthen term imprisonment serve purpose sentencing courts follow map think court consider factors including rehabilitative purposes going consider rehabilitation imposing sentence yes would would procedural error fail consider yes nt think precludes statute precludes considering rehabilitation context imprisonment precludes imposing lengthening term yes require yes court also consider rehabilitation choose sentence probation rather sentence imprisonment think court still require availability require condition supervised
