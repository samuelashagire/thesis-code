sounds like really advocating insolubly ambiguous standard saying unless throw hands end say ca nt figure one means correct interpretation unless case patent valid well federal circuit wrong said test insolubly ambiguous wrong whole problem saying idea appreciable means let say usually ask whether something reasonable mind reasonable person set circumstances reasonable person going act torts reasonable person going engage activity benefits also risks would person situation saying would reasonable skilled artisan situation person setting build device subtle read language carefully seems saying reasonably definite court construction takes emphasis away whether skilled someone skilled art would definite big difference read give construction whether construction definite enough someone skilled art could understand problem federal circuit articulation read decisions focus always question focus seems reasonableness construction opposed reasonableness skilled artisan whether skilled someone skilled art could reasonably construe scope patent see difference says concurrence definition different majority government explain read brief know think difference says difference scope address nt see difference importance running working cancels signal correct majority said function part understanding spacing nt majority said nt know whether equal spacing one could one inch half inch apart bottom line work cancel part scope concurrence said nt ca nt looking specification think definite without right nt see could think justice scalia saying justice breyer saying nt understand purpose spacing definite enough make thing work tell us think concurrence interpretation wrong missing mmhmm result specification agree adversary prosecution history time patent issued reexamination anything else subsequent nt ask question explain says seems logical going stifle inventiveness people ca nt patent issued know get around federal circuit seems say two reasonable constructions one would make patent valid think goes justice kennedy question obligated pick one makes patent valid uhhuh right wrong well apparatus electrodes mounted nt another variable way ca nt say half inch depends said size shape materials electrodes nt also depend apparatus held would nt taken case thought took really extravagant language mean one thing run away language brief another thing deny exists would patent valid concurrence approach prevailed would nt work would would work mere fact spaced somewhere hands touch would necessarily produce result would claim said right whereby whereby would read saying long put spacing point hands touch touching produce result signals equalized read claim yes understand says nt say space electrodes manner signals coming side equal trial error says says know keep electrodes apart apart hands nt touch hand ca nt outside scope hands grip says whereby signals equalized would read would nt work way would let record show justice holding fingers air laughter know understand claim said claim said know fiddle works nt say says know spacing would think long space nt touch widths hands work nt say nt think whereby invitation experiment case talking tell us said high angle never one correct construction even even nt mean always come answer patent office come answer means nt mean ever heard court says well know could mean either one tie laughter win time thing ambiguity always right answer ever decide case would say result appreciably better result reject well still close appreciably better appreciably better would say draw well think test giving us much test really nt seems says long right answer everything else wrong big appreciable nt know subject read overread nt nt patent provide specificity exact spacing nt markman exist different purpose thought markman existed order explain things lay juror lay judge markman test used context trying figure different question entirely think chevron analogy mister mr gannon sometimes say something close tie say couple reasonable constructions number reasonable constructions could pick one think might better close enough nt think ought pick one similarly close enough definiteness requirement met good analogy sure quite got anything would flunk chevron step one would go chevron step two would say kind ambiguity kind ambiguity would get chevron step two also kind ambiguity would fail satisfy definiteness little confused imagine two kinds electrodes blue one green one blue one green one left hand blue one green one right hand let touch blue ca nt touch green got suppose left hand put blue one green one right hand put blue green see touching different distances two hands work look look like one hand one like hand okay work right look green one two inches space green one right one like half inch left hand like one inch right hand okay work asked pretty roundabout way laughter know like put two inches across two inches like half inch know work know nt work knew worked want know work okay soon say point point read guess point made read seems green one ca nt touch blue one whole thing fit within hand catches finger saying nt good enough nt work distance distance document nt tell us nt even tell us distance therefore since nt tell us ambiguous correct argument right think correct argument answer nt even say nt even say nt say go experiment whether somebody great big fingers one hand tiny little fingers hand worries certainly attractive say lawyers come kinds experts know quite often situation ever arises nt know really ever could reflect difference opinion among scientists mean could followed phlogiston logistic theory fire could follow oxygen theory fire update could find different experts would different opinions agreeing absolutely clear doubt patent office often find problem arising say forget long say reasonable experts clearly know said end tell later really find problem tell us mean problem explaining problem ca nt stop mean really go theoretical dispute two scientists opposite theories would agree take insolubly ambiguous standard court used reverse cases two reasonable constructions would patentable would satisfy specificity requirement statute test test levels fair suggested earlier nobody agrees formulation right part answer justice breyer question diagram shows equally spaced relevant case postulated abstract one two perfectly reasonable constructions happens could could go back know two reasonable range chevron chevron analogy comes mind let say one reasonable reasonable type range say patent invalid mean answer thank counsel mister mr gannon say something like appreciably better term may acquire meaning time like reasonableness get good sense means sense federal circuit applying test case mean case series cases close appreciably better something quite different yeah nobody likes finished answer could sentence thank counsel four minutes mister mr vandenberg
