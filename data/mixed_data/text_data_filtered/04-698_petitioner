congress silent subject burden proof find anything legislative history know members nt care look would willing laughter shows discussion yeah well iep iep parents initially agreed decide nt working well want challenge nt burden proof well mean court every court faced problem supposed decide particular case hast burden think open state adopt general rule burden proof statute states purported adopt general rule think invalid case closest one support view court adopt particular rule based scheme rely nt know look guiding burdenofproof cases closest one courts left look case parents unilaterally decided move child private school sought tuition reimbursement well doubt state law burden proof iep iep answer yes states may adopt burdenofproof decide nt mister mr hurd recognize narrow issue parent objecting school iep iep would least burden coming forward words speaking ultimate persuasion burden would nt parents least required come forward reason believe state schooldistrict plan inadequate may ask get three reasons go back something said asked dividing burden production persuasion said one side seems description proceeding said school district goes first school district come forward usual practice administrative hearings first one go defend plan school district parents attacking said school district went result fourth circuit decision parents always go first school district school district plan put forward seemed logical well plan defend think alj alj administrative hearing officer case told state go first school district go first thought maybe burden proof would asked go first nt saying ad hoc thing general practice one goes go onto argument answer justice oconnor remember facts correctly nt quite right child private school years parents nt asking anybody anything private school said longer put child child problems time parents came school district asked iep iep parents nt think acceptable interim placed child another private school case put child private school first sought reimbursement thought mister mr garre numbers overall incidence parents going administrative hearing first opposed school district nt overwhelming proceedings parents one ones initiate hearing go back answer gave going fact happened suggestion maybe parents trying get privateschool tuition reimbursed finding nt district court petitioner appendix fortysix fortyseven district court said parents way prevented iep iep formulated otherwise failed good faith consider hypothetical nt nt hypothetical states nt true states said hearings school district burden proof mister mr garre situation say title seven pointed brief benefit cases person whether social security person making claim burden proof something different setup statute obligate school district come plan thinking title seven case plaintiff prevails merits question remedy employer said propose changes remedy violation would nt employer case burden establishing adequacy plan come remedy problem determination made violation question remedy employer proposes remedy would nt employer burden showing adequacy remedy number states put burden school district indication cost higher states states put burden parents information question asked earlier states said school district bear burden know whether litigation know whether notable increase costs states placed burden school districts excuse nt nt apa apa applicable see school federal base covered act way know military schools dod dod schools governed apa apa well suing federal agency mean federal agency running school least kind school burden clearly going person challenging agency understand purposesofthestatute argument purpose statute always provide relief someone injured conclude therefore burden side order order people injured get relief mean always case fine one sort relief mean relief issue every statute want needy person given justice say since purpose always put burden side nt understand argument sure federal tort claims act know says prologue nt could purpose assure every person injured government tort obtains relief well sense make parents tell school system mean play money mister mr problem assertion decide way furthers purposes statute said cases correctly think statute pursues purpose costs limitations upon purpose course wants students need special help get also want students nt need special help get say harm done know given nt need problem goes better school problem play money coming somewhere namely citizens pay mister mr garre mister mr garre said earlier statement sometimes school district complaining party come would school district take action would nt say child ca nt come class disruptive period cases appealed federal courts normally nt federal courts cases federal courts want condemn federal courts figuring state burden proof well well statute know great detail administrative procedures obviously know decision hearing officer administrative procedures disclosure evaluations recommendations think federal government goes detail nt care burden proof seems unlikely well violation mean totally situation mean say okay say horrible consequences perfectly okay long states mean consequences horrible allow states put burden side understand parade harm never never gets started acknowledge states blow whistle start absent different disposition states government position states change burden background know unless unless think okay know heavens fall nt want heavens fall cases refer involve spending legislation states go beyond minimally required suspect cases really imposition states accept imposition states local school districts often interests local school district quite different interests people know downstate state capital loath think state supreme court says every school district state bear burden proof congress intended case think different different situation spending money coming ultimately pocket school district hearing hearing oh think would realistic divide number hearings rather number heads wellestablished principle administrative law never seen case administrative law party private party coming challenging government action nt bear burden proof alaska nt contrary alaska citing hornbook law whether happens epa epa normally burden proof challenges state action nt change whether bring state proceeding whether federal proceeding nt think quite point maybe know wrong think instance administrative law nt start idea person challenging agency action taken forth nt burden proof think nt right every come mean thing wondered seems hearing examiner district judge actually said law professor dream say oh evidence precisely equally balance nt know happened real world laughter thought judges normally job look complicated evidence say side little bit better side little bit better come lot say area oh exactly right true understand sympathize point worried however fact statute nt cover initial iep iep covers whole range things including example hyperactive child hyperactive child behaves badly class hyperactive child receives discipline related say placed well parents might properly perhaps think unfair wrong might challenge disciplinary mark thousands different kinds issues come issues supposed burden school board example show teacher child sit back class received bad discipline mark something school board prove teacher right would nt related placement say number thinking lot interim decisions come affecting child placed whether class whether class whether special teacher whether without special teacher whether somebody recess periods whether mean complicated matters important overall matters call interstitial matters driving think well expressed one cases new jersey case perhaps burden proof whether matter interstitial whether initial placement change placement burden proof always school board matter well take accept view would federal rule written statute would mean even department education came different conclusion even bunch states come different conclusion even minnesota want rule sometimes one way sometimes way could nt member congress never thought issue think void statute suggests might think would work better left state whatever way wanted left department education promulgate whatever rules wanted could nt hold well nt suggested leaving state suggesting uniform rule would oh default rule right default rule big improvement state way send back say alj alj tried answer wrong question tried answer question federal law really done ask state law hard time figuring perhaps look evidence harder see never heard state without law black hole well mean interesting nt law particularly evidence sides neutral decisionmaker sits encourages decisionmaker decide one thing record blank lot experts decide nt retreat something like announcing oh equipoise sure really look interests child board mean allow sort doctrine left field nothing merits decide case nt question going pay nt parent often go ahead get better program ask reimbursement government nt true many fights occur much education already taken place fighting pays true parents afford pay fact paid child neutral factor course cases say would true true mister mr garre nt contend rule would different prospective ask question described three situations burden least proceeding guess persuasion course difference two trying think hearing officer thought well issue case whether parents objections iep iep valid think first thing want know iep iep best person tell would nt county best position explain done sort get get hearing started forth understand hearing introduces first exhibit first witness may ask jurisdictions burden proceeding different burden persuasion know analytically different issue would seem normal rule would whoever goes first burden course act congress dissatisfied judgments made local whole area mister mr salmons may sure nt misunderstand something said earlier say jurisdictions local option states elected adopt sure answered question tell us states largest volume hearings states burden school number yeah think wanted point mostly jurisdictions court rule right see really unique statute many ways learned years discrimination treated like everybody else statute unusual discrimination wondering find surprising significant free pick right rule picked rule states hearings taken place taken opposite view true apparently really brandnew statute going back statute true period rule litigation mister mr hurd three minutes events seems still cut statutory scheme point parents access initial consultation instances many instances people suing institution nt initial access parents get much initial information petitioners complainants aggrieved persons let point let point something else let assume state affairs assume school districts many independently think collectively school districts talk growing body data expertise iep iep basis say come forward seems though cuts school district expertise think entitled presumption governmental deregularity challenge well extent concerned unnecessarily increasing costs school districts burdens school districts nt uniform federal rule words agree position ordinary allocations puts complainant conserve resources forth allow states different rule dealing administration federal program nt finding violation school district school district interested interested justice ginsburg question let assume show violation law burden showing remedy sufficient ask asking wait minute let say find violation well understanding argument iep iep cases would understand argument state school district said going educate kid throw pot everybody else wo nt give iep iep got fact burdenofproof issue would significance state parents would walk thing satisfy burden proof would say nt come iep iep instead fight whether good iep iep iep arguing words state saying come iep iep state saying going give parents say good enough equalpartnership argument nobody got burden proof know figure per hearing yeah well divide number hearings figure mentioned result arithmetic
