well really nt affect determination violation mean court constitutional violation affected affected upheld remedial power court substantive holding violation would place substantive limits remedies employed nt unless court determines relief meets remedial standard adopted congress narrowly tailored greater necessary forth judgment law equity decree ongoing surely one characteristic equity decree kind modifiable mister mr falk know connection whether automatic stay provision like one justice breyer said like provision automatic stay brought bankruptcy code quite explicit congress court modify condition automatic stay another piece legislation automatic stay court say yes nt think case mister mr falk nt understand analogy tro tro norrislaguardia shortlife orders thought time limits imposed congress squelch courts respect rights defendant slapped injunction told stop many cases ex parte basis think would arguably arguably violation due process court given power stop defendant acting cold court gets around adjudicating merits say talking due process separation powers change time crux talking whether whether congress provided enough time people court make proper decision exactly told justice souter seems take position nt want us treat due process take position even ten years congress simply power terminate judicial decree without change say substantive law going back less chance due process problems chance separation powers problem still one hundred percent assuming situation arises yes nt make distinctions new legislation new legislative action involve call substantive law new legislative action alters remedies available courts surely prohibition applied dealing nonprospectively certainly bad change law substantive law change remedial law let dam dam prospective area distinction change substantive law change remedies court allowed impose future nt see change substantive law say may enforce decree future changing decided going change law basis decree nt see say course one course also function congress enact substantive law function congress enact laws prescribing remedial powers courts within constitutional limits issue whether within constitutional limits nt fully legitimate legislative power congress wrong mean nt think congress could pass statute let take extreme one saying injunction shall issue year year situation totally resolved go back square one bring another lawsuit establish violation yes would position well nt agree mister mr falk come back objection telecommunications policy united states largely directed united states district court district columbia twentyfive thirty years consent decree entered atandt really think congress power simply say want national telecommunications policy directed judicial judicial injunction future henceforward decree shall force effect thing congress could situation amend substantive telecommunications law think extraordinary simply carry plaut equitable decree equitable decrees traditionally revisable seems automatic step well nt know wheeling bridge clear say congress enacted new law think one read differently well suggesting mister mr falk congress ca nt make rules regarding injunctive authority courts look norrislaguardia act thought said moment earlier congress limited dealing referred central authority courts nt think correct think qualify statement good deal thank mister mr falk case submitted thought thought thought understanding like congress introduced new standard cases thought new standard would ca nt go narrowly ca nt go beyond say ca nt go beyond federal right infringed said applies every new case ever going brought also applies old cases future two year period ten month period ninety day period look prospective relief bring conformity standard going apply future everybody oh yes automatic stay course substance issue speaking generally terms substance terms substance thing quickly decide constitutional objection think interpret words shall operate automatic stay like automatic stay say subject termination good cause burden shifted way et cetera words adopt sg sg interpretation words shall operate automatic stay opinion still constitutional problem nt pliable said used words statute set appeals provisions really nt make much sense unless interpret way addition assume intent congress asking least district judges perform impossible would nt perfectly reasonable interpretation words nt demand contrary interpretation well well anything legislative history suggests sg sg interpretation consistent language congress intended well absolutely shifts burden mandamus could nt delay three years get thing decided quickly would nt asking impossible exactly would taking place would automatic stay could set aside cause would mandamus judge nt decide quickly would immediate appeal right would cure yes finish finish say canon avoid difficult constitutional question interpret statute nt made argument say would nt congressman prefer interpretation gave ninetyeight percent wanted rather one gave zero percent perfect mean words one hundred percent struck get nothing nt canon one thing read make sure inescapable inference horror stories judges control one well control mandamus forth may may interrupt point referred say ninety days let assume two years everything else statute except two year grace period following request termination would find constitutional question would also giving think us would assume would adequate opportunity review continuing necessity even complicated decree could say two year example fact operating simply rule default perfectly appropriate judicial process going say boils question time fact question think mean justice breyer suggested think moment ago would imagine would agree going decrees covered statute ninety days entirely adequate kind review probably going would comes boils question time case nt true two year example assuming court fools around would find take would find separation powers violation court simply inactive well congress take two year example think would probably read statute including following mandate congress judicial system law remedies court sitting federal court sitting equity remedying constitutional violations must kind current review mechanism decrees run unnecessarily anything unconstitutional okay also assuming two year example congress changing law remedies gives court adequate time engage review assume two years would give time review decree take would follow argument would separation powers problem case end two years congress effect saying court engage review current necessity giving plenty time two years default rule suspended get busy take position circumstances two years adequate time change law remedies default rule would violation separation
