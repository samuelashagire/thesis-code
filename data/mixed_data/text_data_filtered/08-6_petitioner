perhaps let let osborne osborne attorney address question really equipped answer side evidence trial state art time whatever test current technology become available test testing requests would explain clarify statement said state alaska provides means get information think would nt would alaska one states statute say mean whole controversy whether state obliged give information saying simply picked wrong procedure thought heard say means alaska law could get dna dna postconviction would please explain alaska procedure case alaska defendant postconviction fact able get dna dna testing procedure described said something significant said would allege actual innocence nt done continues put sworn statement actually innocent current procedure still could nt get dna dna gave one case habeas alaska court granted access dna dna evidence nt many occasions postconviction someone moved dna dna evidence alaska courts deny request well told us granted one case happened six two confessions know one parole authorities one referred civil rules discovery criminal cases civil cases ordinarily prove basis claim like nt get civil side discovery pass twelve b giving seeking discovery nt established tenable claim would side concede premise nt say going exonerate know evidence may help may hurt nt know like see claim making lot less say lot less plausible constitutional claim evidence like look saying prove innocent like look evidence might might lot weaker claim thought making claim new scientific evidence prove innocence well saying latter constitutional claim entitlement evidence asserts prove innocence rather constitutional claim evidence might might prove innocence well assuming premise though questioning state art time nt ask course relief would would require assert innocence would nt would bring habeas corpus action claiming state business holding fact innocent nt want wants say know like see evidence might help might help well thought said state indeed granted habeas request case granted habeas request although turned evidence destroyed case surely situation situation existed case referring nt nt make laughter talking case alluded earlier say state alaska indeed provided dna dna evidence agreed provide fact longer existed case surely problem existed justice souter raising person also claiming innocence could nt say sure evidence would produce nt stop state providing thought said still pending think could attach new constitutional right invent would constitutional right get lose get another three years could say especially would assume one constitutional right even assert innocence well would still want leave open make objection chance get trial decided get would nt objections continue apply mean seems concede means get court exceptions states make states make exception gaming system long get habeas corpus seems well leave later whether going concede even though even though nt ask trial get well give away gave away fact going going prove innocence far understand procedural problem tried figure heck line balisok impression mister mr prisoner bringing action challenging confinement effect action going let go solitary prison proceed habeas trying get relief may may mean get solitary get prison go nineteen eightythree way nineteen eightythree complaining action inaction state official violates constitutional right look case prisoner wins going get complaining state violating constitutional right refusing give dna dna seems second question question heart case state constitutional obligation give dna dna would appreciate telling nt reason think fact sorry know time really one question morning would like chance ask trying clear away undergrowth undergrowth first cleared away mind heck question second alaska court decision impression alaska refused test among things could nt say said conviction rested primarily eyewitness testimony bunch reasons ninth circuit matter fact tried blow apart reasons okay suppose agree ninth circuit question constitution united states require give evidence defendant one relevant points mind see would significant advantage defendant even guilty proved whatever advantage okay nt want give undergrowth tried clear away saying read procedure suppose believe ninth circuit right procedure namely tests using procedure favorable enough defendant seeking defendant seeking dna dna wants dna dna pay odds eight one going lose thinks willing run odds wo nt put trouble nt want give procedure tests alaska court nt alaska supreme court say give dna dna evidence unless demonstrate one conviction rested primarily eyewitness id id evidence two demonstrable doubt concerning id id perpetrator three scientific testing would likely would conclusive nt test different give words file new piece paper tomorrow gets dna dna okay true file piece paper court says whatever said pressure innocent says words innocent get dna dna ca nt look consensus statutes states federal government say range appreciation right catches outliers worst would happen outlying states would bring conformity outer reaches whatever set statutes states saying every instance outliers unconstitutional saying instance reasons might unconstitutional namely good way proving guilty innocence practical problem great solve practical problem way mentioned constitutional right bring within one unless one real outlier make argument never win would like know okay look files new piece paper going oppose ground nt procedurally correct one ground two nt ask dna dna trial though might met charge issue trial something different three nt guilty know much evidence met claim nt much evidence okay case front us decide prepared concede going raise things client wants dna dna want repeat client follows procedure please give dna dna give going meet defenses raise wrong procedure ask could gotten trial says nt true much evidence says nt true okay going mister mr rosenstein defense procedure yes nt true dna dna cases person found innocent despite fact confessed know nt one cases right understanding state agreed evidence exonerating evidence potentially could exonerate yes mentioned floodgates seven cases state whole history alaska laughter right floodgates yes may start would want clear question justice breyer asked assume remand would make declaration perjury innocent understood say would enable get discovery necessarily say would get dna dna evidence right nt yes want sure answer understand apply discovery nt know happen right net result perfectly clear argument conceded files paper definitely get dna dna okay give idea many cases say last ten years state postconviction proceedings convicted prisoner asked dna dna evidence three three hundred think constitutional right establish innocence cases new evidence could previously discovered high likelihood exonerating asking position would resist request confirm would acquiesce recommend get dna dna sample conditions would instances attorney general alaska would waive procedural defaults order determine guilt innocence case dna dna conclusively proved simply interest confining innocent people say answer question particular approach duties conceivable state routinely keep evidence sort osborne seeking available cutoff point dispose evidence justice breyer thank counsel afford rebuttal time since court used time mister mr katyal thank counsel mister mr neufeld nt sorry justice stevens thank counsel case submitted well point seeking evidence nt know nt know presumably exactly evidence going show evidence may prove exonerating may one knows tendency evidence one ca nt say preiser problem nt kind problem nt see guess nt follow argument necessarily sounds habeas right seeking damages nineteen eightythree action false imprisonment imprisonment invalid conviction would understand argument saying effect want process know evidence say seeking damages seeking release difference difference succeeds case getting access evidence nt get outside even position go outside prison door get evidence test later finds favorable presumably necessarily going habeas well got nt know whether evidence actual innocence point asserting says want get evidence see say singular objective getting evidence nt know evidence means evidence may conclusively prove guilty know well fair way putting think ultimately strongest argument basic argument evidence potentially important state valid interest keeping least seeing call discovery want something different normal discovery goes ancillary process criminal prosecution oh may getting nt know arguing score saying think saying goes variety justice scalia question alaska statute order get evidence indeed order make postconviction claim got claim evidence material fact requires vacation conviction sentence argument nt know whether requires nt able test want test understand particular statute chance ca nt tell advance test going show nt correct well first tell whether correct nt know test going nt know test going show say requires vacation conviction nt correct okay mister mr osborne nt know evidence going show nt tested whether whether believes innocent whether nt believe innocent walk court understand say absolutely innocent prior testing evidence tell allege evidence going require vacation conviction mister mr katyal right asserting may located procedural substantive due process would like comment government government interest united states state may may effect denying right question occurred going briefs make federal sake united states imprisoned individual came forward said nobody realized eyewitness crime x convicted currently incarcerated fact saw crime committed commit x lawyer arrives individual prison says want talk guy would united states interest saying talk well know prisoners say sorts things nt know whether long run going exculpatory whether guy axe grind question would united states legitimate interest saying x lawyer ca nt even talk would nt need rule guess saying oh okay starting premise united states would legitimate interest hypothetical saying ca nt even talk well let assume let guy talk x lawyer talk guy individuals may say boy moment sun going claim know let assume worst case would still say would government still say interest reason even letting talk nt gotten constitutional law yet want know whether whether would legitimate interest saying mean see defense walks court swears innocent subject penalties perjury please let look dna dna understand answer answer raise issues procedural default waiver et cetera say contrary let look dna dna understanding correct
