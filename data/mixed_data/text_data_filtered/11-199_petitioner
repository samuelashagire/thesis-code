correct difference position government position government says focus rational jury say focus particular jury understand beyond really nt understand difference two positions well let let read two sentences tell whether think difference first one fair possibility particular evidence caused jury convict second statement fair possibility jury would jury would convicted without evidence see difference two difference look win client get new trial let suppose new trial exactly like trial took place every single thing except error corrected right nt essentially harmlesserror analysis well maybe majority court appeals wrong application harmlesserror test nt think reason took took case concerned test aspect thing understand really differentiates position government respect test whether focus rational jury particular jury say focus particular jury nt calling speculation appellate court appellate court supposed tell whether particular jury different hypothetical rational jury panel majority panel majority case say anything differs court said harmless error reverse would point panel majority opinion erroneous nt nt court said exactly seventh circuit said cases want us say want us say reversing seventh circuit panel said said prior cases wrong could tell error actually see add another three potential things calls three potential errors one proved matter fact biased majority points already said tapes played whatever error may occasioned jury using tapes truth really cumulative already admitted bias second sort ambiguous statement trouble meaning defendants similar statement petitioner lawyer error affected influenced jury among three choices never referenced summations however reply error think influenced trial right tell record reflects influence fact asked testimony well client entire defense asking testimony show interested particular part transcript transcript transcript testimony get little practical think understood basic argument defense one woman wife one codefendants tells story jury believed story would acquitted client right assuming saying correct wrong believe error committed affected credibility meaningful way deprived defense saying potential convincing jury assuming argument go back question okay said earlier nt believing believing defense attorney whether defense attorney thought defendant guilty let let taking position case reviewing court circumstance could conclude error harmless taking position case court seventh circuit think committed review error send back right way agreeing dissenting judge think say error harmful saying nt use right formula would say given occurred importance witness harmful error thought thought main point said jury rather hypothetical jury thought main point wrong say strip infected testimony take look rest record rest record warrants conviction harmless error thought saying basic mistake looking looking evidence asking question let take tainted evidence see enough convict saying nt matter verdict would jury error made saying test whether contributed verdict nt matter whether verdict would pronounced absent evidence well harmless error every error harmful every error contributes verdict thing harmless error mean say nt substantially impact verdict means verdict would despite evidence saying test ask whether contributed verdict government says well verdict would anyway harmless error seems would point majority opinion suggests analysis nt look error possible prejudicial effect well mister mr brindley think one difficulty really repeating justice alito question seems parsing things pretty closely ask question whether error altered verdict seems asking pretty much question whether without verdict whether without error verdict would seems like two ways saying thing saying put aside formulation lots courts something wrong looking error possible prejudicial effect understand argument ask question well court nt nt read whole thing little hard understand looking transcript page seven sixtynine right want get understanding right moment client lawyer call beau right okay right client lawyer namely laughter yet seen client right think nt seen client yet say somewhere nt even talked yet something nt even talked beau nt seen lawyer yet say two paragraphs earlier right basically think anyway see top page six lines nt even talked lawyer yet nt even talked beau oh talking lawyer right trying far read think trying want perez plead guilty fair thrust think means right hard tell talking grant thought talking trying thought would better everybody got kind agreement worked says perez wife worry says nt understand going fair comment way beau putting two different ways nt explain way either different story nt ask says yes saying everybody going lose saying whatever wants say nt believe time got reading nt certain talking thought sounded like talking let make agreement everybody going lose could see could say prejudicial could also see government could say nt prejudicial pretty hard read opinion thinking really thinking error mean error mean course would thinking issue says read opinion said well much evidence case opinion weak enough nt would nt made difference nt say take truth dissenting judge common thinking nt know know pretty hard understand means implication lawyer thinks guilty kind context might made difference comes different conclusion saw going nt see big war standards saw judges disagreeing fairly tough question individual case say make change mind think war standards ought okay would satisfy opinion said nt finding opinion totally clear luckily people nt right send cases back us basis right send cases back basis therefore would like clarify whether take actual transcript page reached conclusion back justice problem accept formulation certainly purposes case nt see opinion opinion court appeals focused wrong test nt use magic words started let look big picture said well defense elected put tough sell quotes happens jury ends analysis saying evidence would moved jury convict vasquez without nudge anything heard government case nt see supported theory court says statement yes context opinion first question proceed analyze toward end discussion happened particular case concludes evidence believe evidence believe would moved jury convict argument something like let assume ten pieces evidence evidence one nine properly admitted evidence item ten wrongfully admitted b prejudicial jury looked substantial likelihood think argument jury obsessed focused transfixed item ten improperly admitted would happen concluded jury case facts looked one nine would convicted result saying possible convict likely probably would happened hypothetical court appeals says jury looked one nine properly admitted trial would convicted likely hypothetical nt think item prejudicial looked argument seems stronger argument making sure even works stop government brief see statement analysis look error include error exactly brief question whether jury would convict without considering error look government brief fairly extensive analysis error think important know nt see saying nt look error yes exactly words look prejudicial effect erroneous admitted evidence see altered outcome say immediately sentence gave us say looking evidence whole thank mister mr brindley mister mr yang thank counsel case submitted
