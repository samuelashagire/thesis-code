well number courts come conclusion two crimes arise conduct closely related going go ahead apply sixth amendment requirement related yetuncharged crime majority view lower courts today mister mr coleman understand said everything occurred walker county moving cobb odessa bail everything happens walker county ridley appointed represent cobb walker county law enforcement personnel never consult ridley interrogating cobb repeatedly would still view violation sixth amendment right correct police something nt need words police twice call ridley cobb still walker county twice called said okay question client ridley said yes times something extra police required view event tell going talk client okay said yes mister mr coleman quite range one mcneil case uncharged offenses wholly unrelated different time different place one continuous episode nt courts understand correctly think close relationship offenses part one series events sixth amendment right would attach ms ms blatt gave example think brief indicates would support example crime person already charged burglary ca nt ask homicide time burglary would greater would crime yes legal sense understand double jeopardy purposes got administered police officers police officer say gee homicide lot different burglary nt understand okay nt well would think lay person would understand happened episode readily would understand blockburger workable court double jeopardy determinations workable talking police officer less certain mister mr coleman would make difference crime interrogated factually related blockburger test would greater offense offense indicted lesserincluded offense say attorney burglary charge interrogated concerning offense murder course burglary well quite crime got acquitted burglary acquitted murder course burglary mean blockburger would cover would double jeopardy case say could interrogated without consulting lawyer concerning murder course burglary well nt mcneil say offensespecific satisfies nt satisfy blockburger test quite burden put police officer mean hard enough time applying test say police officer would responsible blockburger analysis really quite demanding name case said clanky well mister mr coleman ms ms blatt hear thank ms ms blatt mister mr greenwood hear thank mister mr coleman case submitted well obvious problem person accused police think kidnapped murdered raped person think distributed drugs know first example could involve three separate crimes second example could involve possession telephone count distribution count one person conspiracy right police indict person one four two gets lawyer next minute turn around start asking questions say oh asking two event mean could constitution mean creates situation every court decided nt mean well mean answer mean think problem led almost courts adopt fuzzier test response rather direct problem wo nt trickery rule know counsel relates offense charged trick involved police total good faith go ask set questions relating kidnapping without telling counsel trick seems trick seems absurd lower courts agreed agreed actually separate crime mean see problem said nt mean crime ambiguous whether describing set events world legal concept look set events world would fifteen seconds could constitute one fifteen crimes police charge basis fifteen seconds realworld behavior three crimes gets lawyer three police able without lawyer interrogate happened real world eight things nt charged purely formal argument purely formal may ask question seems question lawyer appointed scope representation lawyer appointed assume lawyer paid dollar twenty hour state representing defendant appointed represent robbery charge talks client client says lot stuff think ought know order represent well goes interviews great length things happened transaction never indicted would lawyer entitled paid time spent questioning related crimes relation pending charge except part bunch transactions lawyer good conscientious lawyer would say well nt talk going get paid advice give matters nt survive blockburger test fact happened time would nt justify lawyer spending time taking justice ginsburg question little bit suppose situation counsel begin questioning break police say counsel like see outside minute go outside interrogation room say counsel know interested stereo interested murder could responsible attorney say oh well representing go back room ask questions want would amazed attorney could well hypothetical discussing answer gave justice oconnor suppose police could say going question murder want room ca nt go back room true concerned possibility manipulation police hold charge lesser offense merely bide time begin questioning serious offense well think become even harder assume police officer ought know constitutional right interrogate say well maybe maybe nt depending defendant says never given insufficient guidance police well nt understand nt advice gave indication know gave advice talk police anything else fact said police sure go ahead talk murder matter fact nt correct okay mister mr coleman understand argument permissibility kind interrogation related offenses likely cut back effect sixth amendment right attached best argument seems nt recognize sixth amendment right going case adequate warning one nt speak adequate fifth amendment opportunity get lawyer probably one case get lawyer prior commencement continuation interrogation agree probably strongest response concerns expressed people like justice breyer right sorry concern noncustodial interrogations person charged first offense bail police want go interrogate simply see strike conversation guy apartment going get presume going get miranda rights nt opportunity abuse best argument police subtle defendant custody fact raise think specter cutting back sixth amendment right respect crime already charged would exclusion anything said offense would enforceable exclusionary rule okay
