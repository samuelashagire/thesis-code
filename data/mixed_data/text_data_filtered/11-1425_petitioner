jurisdictions incentive get warrant would think even even say nt need one certainly strong incentive get warrants insulates search much greater degree later challenge suppression hearing nt depend practicalities particular jurisdiction every jurisdiction prosecutors judges staying know three oclock oclock morning sunday morning waiting phone ring receive sort electronic message stop somebody wants wants search warrant maybe know big jurisdictions small ones ca nt big jurisdiction one feels afford know fourth amendment permit search take place without warrant could obtained come took long state figure needed without warrant officer testified making drunk driving arrests years think one circumstance need without warrant made need eminently sense impractical get warrant understand decided forego getting warrant nt testimony dispositive case time get took considerable amount time years nt testify causing loss particular case constitutional right exists state get best evidence state want strive fourth amendment contemplates right state must get best evidence reasonable forego fourth amendment procedure intrusive needle going someone body say breathalyzers mind much different intrusion level nt intrude body think almost jurisdictions use breathalyzers instead blood tests small fraction actually use blood tests ruling us today going change going favor going change going favor going change put sort print court print use intrusive way prove case new rule strengthen fourth amendment going suspended whenever prosecution ca nt get best evidence make case define reasonableness would importance search warrant suggest constitutional right suggest judge reasonableness people least efficient people reasonably efficient meaning people police jurisdictions absolutely permit vary terms inefficiency encouraging vary within reasonable range many situations require warrant nevertheless drug dealing house every time people enter house almost certainty going use drugs evidence going disappear rely hope knowing likely telltale signs left thing alcohol situation rely testimony police officer rely implied consent presumption destruction evidence like fleeing situation someone gets away nothing left vastly different okay okay let police officers take blood oh bet rule favor want rural places stopped without independent magistrate approving field officer taking blood said said ten cases past encountered difficulty getting warrant prior cases nothing distinguished case facts cases facts probable cause enough probable cause get warrant think still main rule get warrant must probable cause surely enough never need warrant probable cause think indication jurisdictions inside halfhour ms ms saharsky saying least try since number jurisdictions within half hour say initiate process going hospital halfhour proceed least effort get warrant mentioned schmerber court go could made much shorter opinion simply saying yes blood alcohol dissipates nt pointed particular case delay investigate accident person taken hospital care much time elapsed think two hours nt opinion yes nt need say nt force take breathalyzer test instead forcing needle shoved arm difference reliability acceptability juries breathalyzer test opposed blood draw course nt know disapproved guess point may well permitted would call mistaken belief unconstitutional mister mr koester jurisdictions unless mistaken cop beat apply get search warrant go prosecuting attorney someone prosecutor office first getting hold judge getting hold prosecutor first getting hold judge prosecutor approves right case missouri mean say nt need warrant know even things improve game right mean somebody come ten years say although approved ten years ago without warrant things changed need warrant case nt determination made case case case case whether fact would taken long get warrant would taken long okay without warrant would nt taken long bad totality circumstances test right nt mean enough either right counsel missouri tells us ms ms saharsky breathalyzer good fact expects consequence ruling favor case drunken drivers agree breathalyzer test nt know nt adequate produce result simply put drunk driver paddy wagon way hospital say know going hospital twenty minutes applying warrant get going going know stick needle arm unless course agree take breathalyzer test nt enough force breathalyzer test blow balloon mister mr koester suppose instead waiting two hours procedures place missouri indeed across country possible get warrant circumstances within fifteen twenty minutes would still saying sufficient exigency avoid warrant requirement suggest fifteen twenty would different case wondering would draw bright line maybe drunk mean justice scalia raises point always delay unless talking sticking needle somebody roadside take hospital going amount time going lose ca nt use amount time try get warrant going back justice scalia question person take breathalyzer ever reason warrantless blood test talk know losing evidence every second mean suppose exact thing could said alcoholrelated crimes public drunkenness underage drinking would nt making arguments would would exigency saying weighing costs benefits ca nt mean virtue see saying go get warrant officer picks phone usually somebody duty magistrate somewhere phones says drunk driver wobbling ca nt cross center line wo nt take breathalyzer want give test second judgment officer talk somebody little careful protection necessarily person protection others maybe nt wobbling right think question asked problem adds little bit security warrant really search really necessary would nt take let see long take say took thirty seconds even lot careful would take say three minutes well system phone said man woman policeman virtue man woman trained listen policemen others say things try pin little bit make independent judgment would take five minutes talking reasonableness think relevant us look rules practices states fact states warrant requirement best tell make work well including expedited procedures get warrants within minutes takes usually policemen say twenty minutes get hospital police station anyway see states significant amount states number one require warrant number two many expedited procedures bear determination reasonableness always correct wrong think always thought fourth amendment reasonableness standards national standard suppose forty states know play game suppose forty states rules warrants many expedited procedures still irrelevant nt look showing conviction rate states lower states practice take test without warrant well nt want multiple answers point talk exigent circumstances proceed justice ginsburg suggestion indicates fact ca nt get warrant within fortyfive minutes exigent circumstance justice ginsburg said thirty minutes thought thought often said look whether get warrant break drugs nt flushed toilet forth make judgment time showing made must get warrant think quite incorrect say nt look time factor look time agree uniform standard nt know ever finish answer justice ginsburg suggested uniform rule exigent circumstances suggestion complies objection think fair nt prepare written affidavit number states telephonic warrant give us incidentally nt clear one hour time pardon two hours time stop two hours time put back patrol car know cases suppose judges actually want read affidavit give thought going three minutes members court intruded rebuttal time including give little extra finish thought thank counsel mister mr shapiro thank counsel case submitted
