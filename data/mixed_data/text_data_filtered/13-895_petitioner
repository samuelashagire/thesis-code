said claim many blacks district mister mr schnapper nt right trial submitted proposed findings fact conclusions law fact reference particular districts referenced senate districts eighteen nineteen twenty another place talked majorityblack districts state black belt explained theory case related one districts nt understand general mean plaintiffs saying yes common evidence together usual shaw claim evidence policy statement retrogression going main priority think number two retrogression defined certain way requiring maintenance black voting population going taken account every single majority minority district fact evidence principal evidence case relates every single district sense evidence statewide make less district district case nt understand general mean plaintiffs saying yes common evidence together usual shaw claim evidence policy statement retrogression going main priority think number two retrogression defined certain way requiring maintenance black voting population going taken account every single majority minority district fact evidence principal evidence case relates every single district sense evidence statewide make less district district case well guess would appreciate specific examples seems sort goingin matter say important thing except reynolds inquiry important thing necessarily going affect way redraw put districts might reach target every single district necessarily saying prioritizing racebased racebased thing criterion way going affect every judgment make well three priorities three criteria say absolute important criteria natural effect going minimize two criteria nt deny statewide policy refer every district every majority minority district state nt want press given best answer policy says going prioritize particular criteria mistaken understanding retrogression policy says going prioritize everything else seems pretty good evidence violation policy says going prioritize everything else means going derogation tradition districting criteria sometimes might fail sometimes going able prioritize everything else intent still prioritize everything else justice kennedy question thought answer would nt oneway ratchet cromartie two nt nt cromartie two say political reasons many many africanamericans vote democrat right trying help democrats yeah trying help democrats okay ca nt really prove contrary burden one attacking district whether removing africanamericans one putting issue right right oneway ratchet twoway ratchet case case nt try defend ground get talking second construe filings black caucus plaintiffs arguing acts whole constitute racial gerrymandering say wrong nt get complaint right send back going send back guess would anything wrong saying look tell plaintiffs please point district district fact primary motive racial nt think would hard loads evidence primary racial crucial part justify show making nt know word reasonable attempt good faith reasonable attempt word comply section old section five requirements section five requirements anyway fact questions suggest trying evidence said nt trying nt even read guidelines attorney general nt even look happened past made attempt right would point view anything wrong holding suppose suppose party two thousand one takes minorities heavily minority districts puts opportunity districts political purposes partisan gerrymandering purposes assume party b gets power ten years later wants undo party puts back heavily populated districts violation party b stipulate motive simply help partisan balance partisan imbalance put minorities back heavily packed districts took minorities ten years hypotheticals partisan either case violation use race purely partisan hypothetical case one find minority voters put minority opportunity districts unpacking heavily minority populated districts next party comes simply undoes uses calculus race going tell position think may position first case permitted second case nt unjust unjustified case trying minority opportunity districts partisan purposes asking party b undo partisan purposes sense oneway ratchet suppose based economic data results thing true outset move race order increase capacity influence districts oneway ratchet want one hand obviously move new voters majorityminority districts underpopulated need move enough minorities opportunity elect candidates choice ca nt move many would packing correct hit sweet spot two extremes without taking race predominantly consideration longer need high percentage minority voters maintain situation minority voters still elect candidates choice thank counsel mister mr schnapper think possible state navigate enough minority members district many minority members district without taking race account race predominantly account navigate many without race predominant consideration think think well speculative think alabama reduced number minority voters majorityminority districts significant way attorney general would come like ton bricks preclear plan challenging today thank counsel general verrilli asked remand result remand may well alabama redistrict right would subject section five correct concern thank counsel mister mr brasher thank counsel case submitted
