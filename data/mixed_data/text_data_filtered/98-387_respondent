thank mister mr plowden case submitted mister mr plowden give hypothetical occurred listened dialogue last argument let get away sexual harassment scenario moment suppose baseball field rules school said school hour women female students hour male students rule perfectly clear rule policy fact boys decide want field two hours going let girls athletic director knows nothing says well rule equal time cause action discrimination violation statute misconduct adult hypothetical adult nothing fully informed happened correct result conduct week week week exclusive use athletic facility would view violate statute view hypothetical would nt would violate title ix ix well given two answers violation title ix ix state even purposes injunctive relief say school put teacher field make sure girls equal time nt follow mean violation statute ocr ocr enforce violation statute ca nt enforce ca nt enforce anything given answer justice stevens violation understand answer justice stevens could never injunctive action correct would true even action boy students block admission girls science class group students said going let girls teacher knows principal knows girls nt get take class want take violation title ix ix injunctive relief possible instance federal officials could get relief violation statute oh raised eyebrow mean muscle even though really violation snap attention well nt want us sanction sort thing laughter possible gebser focused course concept school district actual knowledge problem deliberately indifferent liability offer kind standard nt negligence standard well wrong understand exactly assume situation justice stevens hypothetical male students making use school facility example holding gates shut something sort assume could say responsibility coach whoever authority field keep gate open regardless regardless male students mean situations least would able find affirmative action part agent school causing young women excluded athletic facilities problem finding liability something merely merely refusing punish boys something school grounds hypothetical adult member school staff nothing nothing full knowledge nt anything affirmatively say liability case even exclude field also happen beat something like really want teach lesson still liability federal liability think need federal law solve problem well question young young men beating young women leave could could mean justice oconnor think suggesting possibly possibility creating standard strict enough stop administrative problem worried suppose combine suggested school district needs actual knowledge virtually nt respond think implicit opponent suggestion maybe harassment would rise level significant denial program benefit put two things together significant denial program benefit nt teasing things kids get together strict standard liability school district actually know response nonexistent grossly inadequate put two things together would leave kind leeway school district think suggested might desirable apparently think desirable standard proposed justice breyer confident case bar would come standard proposed justice breyer confident knowing case would come simply taking justice oconnor idea school district know exactly response grossly inadequate response virtually response addition harassment rise level denying significant benefit program think discussed side ca nt ideas keeping teasing keeping anything even ordinary know well wo nt repeat high high quite high would say thing title vi vi race let say racial minority school racial majority playing field recess beating minority teachers stand affirmatively encouraging anything stopping would also liability title vi vi concerned fact public schools event children compelled law attend school act sort loco parentis situation school day impose responsibility school result concerned might part parcel background title ix ix mister mr plowden may missed description remedy state law school board totally ignores serious problem authority schools state schools authority expel students discipline things school grounds mean suppose harassment going students get school authority extent sort generalized harassment occurs school grounds say probably authority harassment relates specifically goes school even occurs school grounds think would authority course text title ix ix mean speaks broadly says person shall basis sex excluded excluded passive excluded participation denied benefits subjected discrimination nt say act results technically words statute could nt say individual students violation section ix ix justice stevens example could nt say students prevent girls entering field violates section ix ix well one way read read implicitly saying shall excluded person runs program really certainly another way read anyone excludes someone participation school program federally funded violates title ix ix could read way could nt read agency administers title ix ix around quarter century basic question like statute object statute nt something justice scalia question nt go sexual harassment responsible title ix ix answered recipient federal funds student school well one thing one thing recipient responsible get limitation title ix ix recipient federal funds think nt know whether definition harassment everyone agrees got pervasive got repeated school deliberately indifferent survey referring anybody one exposure could answer yes certainly anyone says would would trigger liability title ix ix well money laughter money nt nt necessary consequence position petitioners argued federal code conduct every classroom country mister mr plowden understand problem people wrestling draw line roughstuff teasing harassment covered hand nt understand hard separate negligence deliberate indifference means know deliberately anything seems hard standard define apply would answer racial harassment mean suppose know imagine severe racial harassment students someone different racially ca nt use program point ca nt benefit educational program likely congress wanted ignored still seems hypothetical black white situation white boys say field whites school nothing still say liability say well title ix ix cover racial discrimination talking title vi vi work way two respect mechanism private right action ocr ocr authority statute front us written guess passive voice person shall subjected seems aids somewhat construction petitioner urging us schools simply duty ensure prohibited conduct nt happen matter causes permissible reading well give reading nt sue school could could sue individual kids sexual taunting individual students excluding people playing field mean accept justice kennedy position passive voice passive voice court ever done
