thank mister mr bernstein case submitted call change substantive law mister mr bernstein rather change evidentiary rules well sort witness competency statute nt mean dealing witness witness would texas allow witness competent witness well thought pretty close hopt convicted felons originally considered competent testify change someone would convicted change witness well witness competency issue nt well statute texas statute talks testimony corroborated exactly witness competency statutes talk well take take traditional common law rule ca nt convict someone confession without corroboration would call evidentiary rule call spoke comparability mister mr fenwick nt prior rule fenwick effect dispensed rule two witnesses treasonous act seems kind rule read prior texas statute nt require second witness sexual act simply required corroboration corroboration example might testimony doctor would examine victim afterwards argument like change like change fenwick situation seems wrong could comment certainly written broader question agree situation like fenwick witness eye witness act thought enough outcry corroboration outcry simply told mother earlier would question mean evidence depends ultimately witness get evidence yes corroboration defendant passed note wife adultery km km well matter texas law though since talking nature thing would texas case says sort corroboration sufficient answer question yes well presumably defendant eye witness said adultery km km nt good enough well say talking us particular ex post facto issue trying get feel exactly texas statute requires mister mr bernstein would argument making carry case evidentiary rule changed rule defendant could bring victim past sexual conduct say say line difficult draw case someone tried treason one witness testifies overt act evidentiary rule failure case sufficiency evidence fenwick case much bill attainder get nt changing general law mister mr bernstein cases seem quite far afield dealing texas law make witness fully competent nt fully competent needed something old days know kinds rules ranking witnesses terms thought credibility like two jews equal one christian seems kind rule dealing fourteen year old regarded fully competent witness legislature recognizes fully competent witness nt see call substantive going witness competency labeling something rather thinking really well statute set texas courts mean nt read quite way say says conviction supportable nt say well simply suggesting going quote statute probably hic verba well let ask question witness understand witness competent witness could testify law texas respect person minor accused person accused crime involving victim minor nt know whether think witness witness qualification case case guess hard time think change amount proof case arguing looking context nt know make context certainly odd system says child victim go uncorroborated testimony adult victim need either corroboration outcry rationale words saying right adult victim think whatever set circumstances whether right wrong may wrong opinion somebody else right whether right wrong victims going need special extra evidence victim stake child serious nt need special extra evidence mean way want look statute well already seen scarcely bright line rule since bench think response difficult draw line talking well yes trick classification mean justice oconnor suggests nt get want go labeling mister mr bernstein would clarify one thing said something eighteen dividing line child nt fourteen nt trusted nt basically child five think could nt possibly consented wanted fourteen texas thought age victim becomes incredible let go statement difference new trial judgment acquittal cases say evidentiary rule would require simply new trial witness incompetent suppose suppose texas second witness testifies appeal testimony stricken hearsay something like confrontation new trial insufficient well nt indicate could something substantive rule dealing client guess convicted several counts dealing counts underlying goal ex post facto clause think served adopting position may interrupt seems collins said distinction useful nt interrupted answering justice oconnor question well really hoping address underlying goals clause trying protect people well nt sympathetic case somebody abusing stepdaughter concerned known fourteen mister mr bernstein one prime bases think would agree ex post facto bar fair crime one thing defendant commits another subject conviction ca nt question fair warning notice defendant could nt anticipated child nt going tell mother mister mr bernstein unlike fenwick case wanted get person indication legislature anything updating rules evidence bringing line modern trend matter attainder treason cases individual commits treasonous act carefully front one witness knows defense whereas pointed moment ago acts committed putative defendant way whatsoever knowing whether going defense suppose core old treason rule fact give defense give person right rely defensively upon care committing arguably treasonous act making treasonous statement front one person whereas comparable argument made well mister mr bernstein general cornyn hear well depends mean evidentiary rules normal meaning think evidence admissible nt admissible kind case evidence admissible admissible goes know sufficiency evidence would nt normally call evidentiary rule well evidentiary rule evidence could nt come could come afterwards rule pertaining exclusion admission evidence nt rule much evidence need convict crime nt basic distinction agree mister mr bernstein texas law previous statutory regime conviction without extra without second witness goes reversed reason new trial well indicate sufficiency evidence problem texas law least nt argument reversal want required witness commands acquittal show texas law least sufficiency evidence problem difference mean suppose hard imagine example suppose state rule certain cases proof stronger reasonable doubt double reasonable doubt beyond shadow doubt one day changed made ordinary reasonable doubt would invoke ex post facto opinion think thing sufficiency ex post facto saying even sufficiency completely still ex post treason case answer understand thank treason case well imagine statute says two witnesses change say nt two witnesses general cornyn could comment aspect interesting tricky case one things seems run cases opponent relies crimespecific particular crime issue whereas rules rely seem changes rule apply across board like convicted felons testify changes hearsay think possible valid distinction well general cornyn appear least acknowledging think case legal change made affected sufficiency evidence required go far yes acknowledge think court brief go say constitutionally significant well kind line draw know constitutionally significant line opponent says line whether evidentiary change sufficiency evidence change justification jurisprudence line apparently want us draw different one general cornyn cited beazell twice mention fourth category say changes rules evidence applied retroactively court words operate limited unsubstantial manner defendant disadvantage one could nt say rule difference enough evidence convict enough evidence convict may call attention one thought general cornyn stressed fact opinions kind ignored fourth category calder collins court concludes holding kring justified ex post facto clause thought include merely calder categories change alters situation party disadvantage nt suggest four calder categories vitality core concerns mean let take third category every law changes punishment inflicts greater punishment law annexed crime reliance interest person deed knew wrong knew unlawful knew knew punishable increasing penalty think insignificant reliance interest nt expect punished much certainly would nt take account well legislature changed penalty maximum one year maximum twenty years well would say reliance interest someone might go commit crime willing serve year willing serve twenty years assume case take beginning point may argue take beginning point ex post facto law lessen government burden proof lose policy standpoint trying understand purposes ex post facto clause seems burden proof government must meet lessened falls rationale basic point answer justice kennedy say rule law made tougher convict somebody raising burden proof could imagine thing would fall within ex post facto clause nt accept lose ground words trying see basic issue case could substantive rule know amount proof would fall within ex post facto clause would lose ground know argue case case involving amount evidence et cetera nt question evidence allowed question much evidence required conviction quite different question difference get exactly evidence two separate trials one conducted stat one one get acquittal get conviction really evidentiary rule know point case dispositive evidence whereas cases say well difference rule let evidence kept evidence got exactly evidence two cases one get acquittal one one conviction make fact conviction without adequate amount evidence required statute appeal conviction set aside new trial conviction reversed defendant released tried found guilty whereas evidentiary mistake texas elsewhere conviction defendant retried correct statement texas law well seems indicate really significant difference rules evidence rule issue well let assume neighboring jurisdiction new mexico treats procedural suppose could federal ex post facto rule different two states accept state characterization law incorrect thank general cornyn ms ms brinkmann
