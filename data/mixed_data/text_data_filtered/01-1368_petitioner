well applied private employers suppose congress rely commerce clause powers applied states specific reference statute course section five equal protection yes throughout opening brief never referred statute told us four one justice scalia referred nt reply brief even acknowledged congress said promote goal equal opportunity men women statute says pursuant equal protection clause well ca nt fitzpatrick v think case would stand analysis rather similar mister mr taggart first rule statutory construction read read find said promote role equal employment opportunity women men pursuant clause promote goal equal opportunity women men nt mention five opening brief well one would look statute one looks house senate report pursuant mister mr taggart thought part argument discrimination nt exist anymore state even one time provision would sunset far title vii vii concerned many states vast majority states title vii vii laws point time guess reasoning fitzpatrick bitzer would go title title vii vii pattern practice justified result original title vii vii passed court never declared law differentiated basis gender unconstitutional extended public employees seventytwo court begun address issue yet court said congress could seventytwo special record kind record extent existed made race sex mister mr taggart scores title vii vii cases nice neutral standard decision maker decision maker exercising discretion general standards time time decision maker duplicating whether race sex people nt look like decision maker say gee suspect discrimination countless title vii vii suits prevailed standards nice neutral discretion whether hire made someone coming results exclude people think state employers people hiring promotions states nonbiased unprejudiced nt affect decision makers state level opposed municipal level private employment title vii vii lead taken states several states human rights laws long federal law least states title vii vii valid legislation sign least good federal government need house senate report mean text statute nt say order assure equal protection laws states says says requiring leave requiring requiring manner consistent equal protection clause minimizes protection potential employment discrimination read saying done eye sure conformance equal protection clause quite different saying order enforce equal protection clause violated states statement text goes manner goes manner purpose mister mr taggart thought reason nt refer reference equal opportunity men women reference equal protection clause people people people individuals could fail provide equal equal opportunity men women without violating equal protection clause asking distinguish title vii vii know challenging could said general knowledge statute construing nt go sex discrimination general goes particular type sex discrimination granting leave least ca nt say matter general knowledge states violation provisions leave idea state state certainly need evidence show violating particular aspect equal protection would think brief brief agreed zero percent brief answer quite clearly nt think proportionate even violation shown nt brief said five many states covered act many covered act many states act fifty many private employers covered yeah like many think hundreds thousands six weeks adopted fifty states mind argument propounded clear six weeks designed fifty states never mind hundreds thousands private employers seem plausible insofar statute applied private employers could possibly directed unconstitutional conduct well statute findings beginning refer equal equal protection clause say consistent equal protection clause fourteenth amendment nt well mister mr taggart ms ms pillard thank mister mr taggart case submitted mister mr taggart would comment argument think really elaboration findings purpose statement justice breyer referring think distill statements something like know fact historically whenever burdens family responsibility allocated allocated woman man employment standard expressly says got treat exactly alike women always get short end reflected hiring decisions among others secondly order make determination practical one ca nt simply leave whatever men women vice versa way make work think argument based effect two sections nt sound like simply end run phony commerce clause argument would comment argument well given fact accepted prior cases pervasiveness phenomenon seems quite clearly reflected findings purpose necessary say well yeah already said supreme court already accepted pervasiveness got go step say well yeah pervasiveness even goes states nt point point made fact title vii vii goes discrimination basis sex general doubt states engaged engaging time okay passed statute without twelve weeks statute simply said family leave decisions decisions got standard making got whether employer employee man woman would constitutional section five okay difference case sorry nt mean interrupt trying get another question justice scalia difference case put case got twelve weeks suggested one reason twelve weeks decision part congress nt put period time threshold period time nondiscrimination standard nt going worth anything example outside case states could say okay going give one week maternity leave men women obviously nt going accomplish anything congress says got kind threshold order make requirement neutrality really work reasonable way get point think agree would perfectly lawful exercise power section okay take given nt concede nt seem plausible however period time designed view pervasive history discrimination government applicable applied government reasonable unreasonable however come applied private industry nt fair argument looking text lines text talks findings says due nature roles men women primary responsibility family caretaking often falls women says employment standards apply one gender serious potential encouraging employers discriminate people gender take mean without state employers well others tend say woman go take care sick mother employers know wo nt hire women says five six would thought sounded like equal protection laws statute designed help remove one major reasons employers discriminate women five six says ten lines says pursuant fourteenth amendment whoa whoa whoa wait accept take accept proposition congress sufficiently shown far anyone need state employers discriminated hiring women gener accept right guess goodbye title vii vii whole bunch things accept asking distinguish title vii vii asking purposes case accept proposition adequately shown state employers like lot employers discriminate women hiring people general like yes answer answer could okay time statute oh okay accept proposition adequately shown state employers discriminated women passed law okay nt see distinction title vii vii goodbye accept argument think earlier imagined wo nt concede think take hypothetical imagined state employers shown discriminate women hiring would nt congress quite lot leeway choosing remedy discrimination would nt statute part remedy words absolutely answer far see case whether adequate showing time statute state employers discriminated women hiring answer question view adequate showing appropriate remedy answer view nt adequate showing course would win basically seeing case got put kind threshold mean something come particular period particular number weeks presume real question whether directed discriminatory conduct private discrimination constitutional state discrimination constitutional question nt question whether directed discriminatory conduct nt basic question concede directed discriminatory conduct directed discrimination discriminatory conduct would embrace states private employers would nt suppose two statutes one congressional statute says states must employment pay policies differentiate basis gender second fmla fmla seems fmla fmla much limited twelve weeks damages capped simple operate would think much proportional congruent statute described mean holding upholding money damages fmla fmla take concede nt nevada bound follow law laughter laughter recognize conceding point predicate applying states even non six weeks antidiscrimination shown assume point past argument appropriateness means somehow categorically different states appropriate appropriateness means respect private employment
