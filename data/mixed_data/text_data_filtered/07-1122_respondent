recognized several cases found like one stillaquamish whatever said yes recognize nt recognized nineteen thirtyfour federal jurisdiction nineteen thirtyfour treaties applied federal government indians gave indians rights seems consistent collier others say would nt know question ask congress kind thing would delegated secretary decide hard think congress wanted delegate power secretary decide whether happens mean nineteen thirtyfour means time future well mean something congress would decide meant nineteen thirtyfour meant old time applied could argue ways would want delegate human would want say meaning word something leaving secretary saying unambiguously means saying saying totally ambiguous secretary say enlightening insofar secretary knows fine insofar delegates power secretary make mind difficulty tribe thing think difficult case hard time difficulty word tribe either tribe people indians nt right true people indians let imagine tribe indians within definition act saying act would give secretary power take land entity members within act pretty hard accept well one thing says purpose give secretary power take land tribe purpose giving land indians assumed tribe members indian special definition collier would wrong collier great famous colloquy says adds four words says committee would limit act indians act would limited indians federal jurisdiction except indians onehalf indian blood would get help thinking mind kind entity person onehalf indian blood fine secretary act suppose entity people less onehalf indian blood luck unless federal jurisdiction seems help would apply justice breyer suggesting earlier maybe make distinction federal jurisdiction recognized tribes chief justice question going put question mister mr olson whether canon construction principle federalism makes us cautious take land jurisdiction state sounds plausible authority proposition stated said cases said opposite overriding principles must cautious interpret statute depriving state ownership jurisdiction land anything cases either way point statute reads whether read saying recognized indian tribe federal jurisdiction saying way makes sense read nt oh applying talking indian descent indian descent nineteen thirtyfour determining words say indian descent oh see united states v court describing indian indian descent went way include brackets phrase recognized nineteen thirtyfour tribe federal jurisdiction well may shown ambiguous shows shows resolved ambiguity talking extraordinary assertion power secretary gets take land give whole different jurisdictional status apart state law would nt normally regard types definitions restrictive way limit power instead saying whenever wants recognize gets authority say longer rhode island jurisdiction

would limited housing right could engage activities indian tribes engage correct course friend side says exact opposite backwardlooking allotment policy decided good idea yet resulted indian land turned fee simple way compensate discredited allotment policy nt recognized nineteen thirtyfour penalized allotment policy nt need benefit think backwardlooking perspective seems make perfect sense indian indian community looking definition indian go back first sentence well four times ought give effect least says indian tribes federal jurisdiction seems key restriction taken away last sentence reiterates indian tribe last clause refer still indians residing one reservation defined term course sorry jump back provision disagree interpretation congress thinks wrong pass another one fifteen sixteen provisions says tribe recognized well sorry keep longer may want laughter else would congress enact fifteen sixteen separate provisions think provision think necessary thank counsel mister mr olson four minutes remaining ms ms maynard would clarify one thing sentence question word forth meaning includes descendants less halfblood quarterblood eighthblood forth expansive definition term indian right ask question seems limited definition tribe really quite irrelevant case term indian defined include two classes persons one members certain category tribes others half indian blood seems get definition tribe comes later seems talking definition tribe statute would exactly meaning instead limiting time nineteen thirtyfour said tribes located west mississippi limited would nt limited definition indian mean definition tribe would made category persons indian dissent eligible treated indians whose eligibility determined tribal membership limited include tribes limit say tribes west mississippi get defining term tribe definition think fight means totally irrelevant meaning definition tribe describes subcategory indian tribes members qualify even though nt half blood point picks
