well every court appeals considered question said cage applied retroactively nt right wrong guess view shed light us many verdicts would affected clarification made must applied retroactive many give example gideon mean say watershed rule gideon watershed rule vast space gideon watershed rules well think would like know positive example nt watershed rule gideon counsel based argument fifth circuit wrong allowing district court consider successive petition well asking question short time frame court appeals determine whether going allow successive petition district court got question would space saying court appeals within short time cut pass problems appropriate court say got case us decide case going another case road would present question retroactivity going say case nt present question direct review case us courts nt operate way decide cases gideon example well clear case would court would made retroactive court nt say expressly gideon would think watershed rules mean surely around nt really nt understand makes watershed rule unless believe say effect nt know people believe well sitting waiting wo nt able get benefit retroactivity saying saying serve right raised first habeas saying one results edpa edpa  congress particularly sympathetic second habeas petitioners edpa edpa thank mister mr heuer mister mr feldman hear nt discussion perfectly good reason say analyze way court appeals anything alter situation present case thank mister mr mister mr larson three minutes remaining would accept dicta words say make within meaning edpa edpa even though say dictum would would decide case make statement statement way going retroactive would dictum far case concerned would satisfy concept made edpa edpa well edpa edpa require holding words example appeal first habeas question issue get case declaration would holding holding required dictum satisfactory nt straightforward application thing teague equally satisfactory could understand line saying got holding court nt got holding court teague less worthy dictum defendant takes appeal second terms gatekeeper allow gatekeeper theory take nt allow anything conclusive determination take view requires holding holding could look would holding system works right would holding first habeas sure understand distinction case would nt satisfied dicta case direct review case direct maybe nt understand answer mean determination gatekeepers supposed make determination whether case go forward determined turns retroactivity decision decision retroactive gets gatekeeper said reverse reach issue reach another issue dictum view saying saying wrong going forget going say something said said earlier would made right reason nt well would nt one would nt one argument mean might find easier address specific specific take cage sullivan people always understood judges make mistakes jury instructions every day week important cage sullivan suddenly see misdescription reasonable doubt standard like important automatically get new trial matter thing compares lawyer two cases thought yes could make mistake instructions maybe even bad one instructions recognized kind mistake unique among others like lawyer argument think significance reshaping legal thinking jury standard misdescription right principle nt watershed nt watershed irrespective principle eight years since court decided sullivan would thought thousand people respect trial courts fact used wrong standard would thought idea bringing habeas petition mean habeas petitions filed thousand okay number thousand number habeas petitions filed include question many habeas petitions filed knowledge include question come across personal experience one yes think unmistakable imports sorry finished finished answer justice kennedy unmistakable import idea sometimes court might say retroactive collateral review rather unmistakable import opinion nt good enough answer yes sure whether said good enough put anomaly creates even example cases obvious like flagburning court says flagburning ca nt punish ca nt punish writing editorial newspaper criticizing government know certain conduct punish absolutely clear category court made certain conduct unpunishable criminal law kind thing teague says retroactive even absolutely plain reason still opinion retroactive unless court adds words retroactive fair court mean court court writes opinion unmistakable import retroactive collateral review would satisfy though think right satisfies guessing mean sorry want words unmistakable import nt good enough say words take conclusive determination court could determination first habeas run statute limitations problem statute limitations seems say year right cert initially recognized supreme court going within year going come habeas supreme court instance let say absolutely clear reasoning meant apply retroactively never mean put court impossible situation would nt let assume never said whether cage retroactive let assume successive habeas petition could ever make determination substantively thing court appeals answer according take whether said court appeals right never said nt end matter ever reach question successive petition talking wait first habeas petition direct review say answer question justice breyer asked colleague primary conduct held punishable matter law also subject retroactivity principles talking different rule first rule teague involved even beyond power law punish mean nt somehow automatically retroactive case reach substantive retroactivity question assume never said end court appeals right dismiss reverse court appeals court appeals correct get started may ask agree cage new rule interrupt mister mr heuer interrupt one thought ask question whether rule retroactive think really asking whether rule applied time trial arguing time man tried need better reasonable doubt instruction nt ask question law time trial need better instruction got new rule new rule entitled instruction time trial seems nt saying response justice souter read word made mean said nt say said mister mr feldman petitioner argues alternative sullivan made retroactive could case make retroactive say second argument agree could agree cage new rule
