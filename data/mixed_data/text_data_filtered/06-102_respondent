middle range found booker found booker least way lower federal courts interpreting booker use guideline range within guideline range automatically reasonable nt worry nt held nt believe federal courts held go beyond guideline range automatically unreasonable case california system go beyond middle range automatically unreasonable unless unless find one aggravating facts justification federal system could know sentencing commission thought reasonable sentence crime disagree authorities think little know ought simply disagree sentencing guidelines could point justice breyer suggests well sentencing guidelines may okay jurisdictions jurisdiction special problem regard kind crime nt find special fact california nt federal guidelines federal guidelines judge could say know think offense serious sentencing commission thought reasons dissent know sentencing commission determinations reasonable surely reasonable disposition open federal district judge say well thought took account seriously considered think wrong think serious could perfectly reasonable determination could nt done california well true certainly nt argue way papers thought finding aggravating factor simply think deterrence statute says deterrence requires statute says really position judge thinks deterrence requires middle range reason alone say ignore middle range say brief nt seem comport saying judge exceed base range example applying enhancement alternative sentencing scheme predicate fact enhancement alternative scheme must pleaded proved jury beyond reasonable doubt indication judge could say think deterrence necessary therefore going exceed base range totally incompatible well aggravating factor talk need deterrence aggravating factor aggravating factor aggravating factor basis imposing harsher sentence nt aggravate crime opposed crime committed individuals aggravating factor think california supreme court california legislature would astounded think wrought obviously intended establish scheme judge would apply middle range using perception whether punishment justified unless circumstances crime make person guilty usually mean aggravating circumstances fact believe crime bear general bear higher penalty think would astounded find created would want us hold know uphold system opinion says california sentencing judges may california law described us may exceed middle range whenever think better result whenever think reasonable think california would happy well including reasonable disagreement level severity legislature provided middle term mean legislatures may provided higher severity judge says simply disagree california legislature reasonable disagreement legislature might done nt reasonable nt reasonable ties says disagree california legislature whether enough prevent defendant committing kind crime look cites another state provides much higher sentence crime possibly unreasonable nt mean reasonableness mean something else know case california trial judge gone beyond middle range basis fact judge found rather basis general policy thinks punishment greater something along lines justice breyer suggested either would astounded trial judge would read statutes court rules way would nt necessarily fact could fact says speak circumstance related crime offender case aggravating factor found judge impose upper term grant language seems next paragraphs seems say something little different language take seems say unless judge find fact situation would make reasonable go middle range ca nt law says admit find little difficult distinguish blakely cases dissented court law majority says seems almost like unless tell wrong well critical nt understand appendix page three brief sentence read seems say opposite two sentences list federal judge bound guidelines must consult guidelines say aggravating california says discretion available california law may include fact judge reasonably determines relevant determinate sentencing law upper term comparable booker requirement federal judge sentencing decision unreasonable well assumed minute first statement trumped second see court rule certainly court rule possible given read permitting particularly second statement could read second statement saying yes say particular instance kind sentence seemingly mandated middle level community contrary purposes punishment giving higher one honest nt know black means clarified nt know think read opinion way saying would say california court good court conscientious managing huge system criminal law state probably bigger federal system reads blakely see guidelines california previously understood violated thinking maintain system constitutional therefore write twelve sixtyone read saying bookerizing come close booker necessary make constitutional would understandable judicial reaction read opinion saying point certain supposed say doubt unease reflects fact prior black california would pretty unheard judge depart upward grounds factual grounds related circumstances crime offender also doubt opinion written try save california system right difference federal system judge go reasonable based facts found jury california go beyond middle range upper range must fact found jury correct correct whatever reason correct one hand one case unreasonableness depends finding fact made jury federal system require finding jury question may ask subject may ask question read brief filed national association amicus brief national association defense lawyers long discussion practical consequences states california find honest rather persuasive fact big deal thought might like opportunity tell whether something brief accurate say remember correctly impact four day trial would normally extra hour jury burden system course ninety percent cases pleaded guilty major thing originally thought might think across board fairly accurate description happens states far advised sure way black court interpreted black court talked requirement upperterm sentence imposed aggravating factor exists whole problem case incidentally rules four point four one oh general objectives sentencing term art different circumstances circumstances found preponderance evidence general objectives still considered involved case criminal whose conviction sentence reviewing circumstances aggravate require findings findings nt reasonable well old record playing reasonableness requirement explained explain find must findings preponderance evidence aggravating mitigating circumstances set different objectives sentencing objectives sentencing involved case may ask question excluding capital cases view anecdotally percentage cases go juries go jury trial result bifurcated proceedings sentencing purposes ten percent yes two hundred thousand incarcerated last looked sorry could tell court rule talking set many cases would resentenced reverse case thank mister mr laurence mister mr gold four minutes remaining understand construed saying go middle term without discrete finding fact beyond proven jury unreasonable matter law unreasonableness matter law feature distinguishes federal system post booker necessarily mean must make discrete finding fact order come back justice scalia hypo moment ago go know theory booker go guideline range consistent policy positions may precise without necessarily making discrete findings fact mean judge individual case possibility california system possibility saying us california system california judge went exactly thought process justice scalia outlined put paper without finding discrete fact beyond elements jury found could go third tier really think deterrence requires third tier middle tier california judge right even selecting term within base range going read rule four point two oh part b circumstances aggravation mitigation shall established preponderance evidence way refer judges reasoning policy way refer proof fact nt see subsection b well reasonableness constraint also reasonableness restraint requires finding discrete facts reasonableness two exclusive rule seems conflate seems clearly conflate finding discrete fact seems got consider rule responding ambiguity justice breyer referred moment ago ambiguity got read light subsection b means fact finding think subsection b right seems hold position consistently state rule court black repealing rule court mean black refer back black get ambiguity justice breyer raised order solve ambiguity look court rule court rule admit judge policy consideration however sincerely held could satisfy requirement prove aggravation preponderance nt end issue mean california wants amend rules statute california business ca nt nt give different answer question nt say reasonable court conclude deterrence really requires something tougher middle term enough nt say enough b okay let judge judge bench says much crime community look statistics believe deterrence requires something heavier middle tier nothing unusual particular crime making policy decision law require general would satisfy part b would satisfy requirement puts establishing preponderance evidence understood california law position moment reasonably answer problem
