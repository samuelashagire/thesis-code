difference moral burden jurors psychological burden jurors situation find aggravators outweigh mitigators therefore make affirmative finding leads sentence death opposed situation say ca nt decide applicable burden proof side weightier therefore allow default rule dictate sentence going find agree beyond reasonable doubt aggravators mitigators equipoise allow default rule dictate sentence death nt right particular reason provided case equipoise sentence would death quirk way provision written yes arizona burden placed defendant prove mitigation yet court upheld even equipoise situation dissent kansas put burden defendant going address questions think added question whether kansas supreme court judgment adequately supported independent state ground sure adequately addressed jurisdiction kansas supreme court vacated capital murder judgment remanded said would done anyway state law evidentiary error concerning admission third party guilt evidence independent ground mean nt jurisdiction thing another ground well case remanded new trial presumably conviction sentence could come back way cross appeal like take civil case judge gives standard charge imagine two plates scale equipoise find party burden proof make comparison pretty clear burden proof defendant answer equipoise question must come death verdict understand situation death penalty kansas result decision movement legislature change law wo nt situation death penalty sorry instruction got one one instruction number gotcha way end four okay seems sounds different put differently surely reasoned moral response say found horrible aggravating factors murder even usual murder terrible aggravating factors three found find mitigating evidence outweigh aggravating factors seems perfectly valid moral response seems equal weight predominate jury saying nothing outweigh aggravating factors well course jury nt free falling moral judgment make accepts judgment majority people kansas certain aggravators aggravators shall counted defendant shall even juror believe morally particular aggravator ought though law says somehow jury juror able make like solomon moral judgment fellow one things kansas law prescribes equipoise people kansas think aggravators specified serious enough unless something overcome death penalty appropriate seems moral judgment within limited range moral judgment jury accorded depends mean presumption certainly certainly says unless find something outweighs death penalty proper penalty burden jury find something outweigh absence finding something outweighs aggravators found death penalty proper penalty ask question goes response justice souter last question understand scheme maybe understanding wrong found existence aggravating factors justify death penalty move penalty phase decide whether fact death penalty would imposed ca nt eliminate one aggravating factors found take account aggravating factors found nt right right state made judgment particular offense called aggravated murder know whatever capital murder name implies warrants judgment death unless mitigating factors indicate proper moral judgment nt even state said opposite still stateprescribed moral judgment state said capital murder warrants judgment death mitigating factors outweigh aggravating factors still stateprescribed moral judgment nt well furman hard tell voice

aggravating circumstances hard understand want sure fellow morally speaking somewhat deserving death average says reason mitigating circumstances everyone means somewhat less moral morally undeserving cuts way reduces makes less deserving death morally speaking juror feel say absolutely balance absolutely balance every fact aggravating side puts thinking morally speaking deserving death mitigating

approaches problem wondering gets laughter course means comply lockett want ask one question goes back colloquy justice souter justice scalia justice scalia pointed state made moral judgment certain state facts death penalty shall imposed agreed true cases back nineteen seventyfive six state statutes mandated death based moral judgment state certain circumstances think one north carolina statute ask us reexamine cases rely proposition situation mandated death penalty perfectly okay course aggravators would permissible state include aggravators necessary narrow category definition crime would say state met burden mitigating substantial mitigating evidence would permissible state mandate death penalty answer yes think fully consistent north carolina case well way justice blackmun interpreted majority majority nt quite say said burden defendant prove sufficient mitigation justify something death penalty conceivably one could met burden substantial mitigating evidence came even majority opinion dead right justice blackmun said would agree would consistent text majority opinion say really meant prove enough mitigating evidence make death inappropriate sentence could less even fifty fifty balance well would nt true amended statute would amended statute take fifty fifty problem would nt seem difficult could still impose death penalty twelve people nt tried ameliorating

think think word used state take must prove beyond reasonable doubt sort could walk capital murder includes case involved one person second prove beyond reasonable doubt mitigating factors outweigh aggravating factors already established take moral answer also stands us scales already tipped stands us shown beyond reasonable doubt committed aggravated murder obligation show us excused penalty done take anything came brought attention say outweighs well let ask ask rather presumptions look case matter shifting burdens proof take constitution require state introduce mitigating evidence

argument couple times referring reasoned moral response difficulty squaring reasoned moral response construction kansas court agree proper construction equipoise kind provision kansas right understand define regards aggravating circumstances support death verdict kansas done kansas also saying jury find aggravators defined outweigh mitigators seem reasoned moral response assuming reasoned moral response would death penalty imposed aggravators outweigh kansas saying even though death result anyway nt seem like reasoned moral response answer well issue seems stark finding proven equipoise means aggravators basis death sentence equipoise finding aggravators nt predominate make conclusion right fence seems call reasoned moral response fence execute anyway seems total inconsistency decision says nt know done aggravators define basis execution mitigators define basis life equipoise verdict says many words nt know important kansas says jury comes back says nt know result death seems inconsistent notion reasoned moral response case case nt find mitigators outweigh case find mitigators equal weight get equipoise question failure mitigators predominate sufficiency mitigators equal weight poses problem seems course predominate something precise merely predominating fact effect nt know know nt predominate fact know equal right nt nt know whether case understand question jury could return death verdict equipoise situation kansas supreme court defined statute allowing possibility constitutional nt yes yes law kansas mean thought correct wrong may made wrong assumption thought finding guilt aggravated murder preface determination whether aggravators mitigators predominate based upon determination decision whether sentence death life right point nt way knowing take whether penalty life death okay okay getting nt understand kansas scheme determination guilt aggravated murder create presumption favor death penalty okay right fact let think got terminological problem fact finding guilt aggravated murder tantamount understand finding aggravating factors considered penalty phase also found correct okay okay general may may like pose question least gets nub issue see get response premise question generally regard mitigation evidence favoring life aggravation evidence favoring death got case assumption evenly balanced pans scale exactly even kansas says case jury shall return verdict death going demand said going demand determination death penalty determination would one called reasoned moral judgment supplied order make kansas provision consistent reasoned moral justice seems presumption favor death things equal presumption favor death question correct saying order hold way hold eighth amendment consistent eighth amendment presume
