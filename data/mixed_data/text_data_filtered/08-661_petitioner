well let give another example mention brief nfl nfl teams agree among regarding scheduling play sixteen games year playoff schedule wo nt play games would clear case rule reason mention amici mention example english football leagues operate differently well one team wants one teams wants play additional games rival team get money joint venture respect television rights meaning separate activity televising shows issue solicitor general saying joint venture licensing trademarks quality control et cetera nt substantial difference could nt could nt stop team joining another league let assume know nt know enough football let assume two leagues playing one plays saturday plays sunday suggesting joint venture could nt stop members joining league purpose venture free reject go somewhere else counsel solicitor general asking us remand new test find whether challenging joint venture challenging simply licensing one individual one entity answer meaning nt could using example could tell different questions would single control theory proposing rule reason application normal course questions would ask theory differ would happen rule reason analysis let go case let let stay single commissioner well stop group competitors coming saying gee want sell gas going let single commissioner decide much gas sell chooses sell price everybody gas products okay get cover everything nfla nfla everything subject agreement concerted action everything sherman act goes rule reason analysis things escape entirely antitrust analysis mister mr nager think answered question originally yes everything separate entities agree everything agreement every case nothing would take outside would put everything rule reason analysis one one concern litigation know nt come sherman act go home case dismissed pleadings say got rule reason analysis discovery costly thought feature case plaintiff wanted discovery court said enough point client nt hurt dealt exclusively one manufacturer nothing damages find goes back would would bear burden work mister mr nager figure issue us issue whether lower court wrong dismiss suit basis unitary operation think issue well worrying stuff thought thought read complaint almost every word pro per se violations forget right forget yes forget okay suddenly heard talk thing left could see say agreement grant exclusive license reebok unreasonably restrained trade markets supposed focus paragraph want focus interested complaint moment yes okay looking complaint fine get point asking question heard say want example want patriots sell tshirts competition saints whoever red sox right see point red sox know baseball better want red sox compete selling tshirts yankees right yes okay nt know red sox fan would take yankees sweatshirt gave away mean nt know going get expert going say competition two products think would rather would rather wear baseball football hockey shirt going go back prove actually competition yes case small allowances three years old laughter think guess right right going try prove yes yes trying look trying get mind specific restraint focusing listed three four one want effect joking true arguing yankees compete red sox selling shirts another thing complaining one understand less teams got together agreed would one person sell stuff together think individually decided whether choose one person maybe choose two people three right find find easier think case know going certain irrelevant given justice scalia persuasive remark withdraw question laughter question understand much better light nt see point certain better characterize single entity case get kind confusion think exists case say look joint venture panagra creates joint venture course going buy things like office space employees reasonable definition nt even look things close enough see take criteria seventeen page seventeen excellent criteria mind say criteria decide whether ancillary parts joint venture reasonable also reasonable would nt say per se saying justification reasonable reasonable legitimate joint venture ancillary part legitimate joint venture people attack going easier attack tried attack call single entity well look second criteria opens attack precisely way use rule reason going show nt significantly affect actual potential competition therefore file claim say win second criteria precisely person filing claim saying unreasonable talking terminology worries terminology think lower courts taken copperweld terminology transferred place think perhaps belong changes rule apply make change make give passer protection really hurts certain teams mostly run rule reason well know litigation system know well hypothetical two three teams nt particularly popular league hurt rule change notice notice owners sit around room liable conspiracy mean serious stuff triple damages nt question really justice ginsburg give us zone sure rule reason inquiry would inappropriate take care summary judgment nt sort section one carveout joint action everything rule reason well seems exploring consequences completely discarding unitary theory earlier questions seemed helpful saturday sunday scheduling issue seems pretty clearly face limit competition one day instead two days justice stevens said suppose makes better players rested perform better take purpose question still nt get answers nt know difficult area would like would like guidance mister mr chief justice may please court think focusing rather mundane aspect nfl nfl commissioner powers may help explain united states foursquare support either party theory case among powers vested commissioner nfl nfl nfl nfl constitution power incur expenses carry ordinary business league includes renting office space hiring employees procuring supplies commissioner pursuant delegation authority decides company going acquire paper league offices decides weight scale secretaries league offices view conduct single entity may commissioner power things ultimately derived consent individual teams within league consent given authority centralized commissioner decision paper supplier wages employees guess would say two things first thing law concerted action per se legal per se reasonable guess point instance disappointed bidder paper supply conduct contract challenged section one violation said commissioner decision go staples rather office depot unreasonable office depot offering better product lower price certainly decisions commissioner could make respect procurement supplies setting wage levels would unreasonable business judgment sense would nt effectively carry mission organization would nt unreasonable section one sense thing would say line argument could made copperweld court could concluded well well dagher instance court dealing situation ways analogous one joint venture entities economic competitors aspects businesses joined forces respect aspects court dagher nt squarely resolve questions whether section one applied said pricing products equilon joint venture acting single firm single entity point would like make paper employee example view nfl nfl commissioner carrying functions behalf league would acting single entity even though power derived consent teams jets giants agreed among wages would pay secretaries would buy paper would entirely different thing fact teams purposes part think section question whether section one applied would different central section one may red herring respect ultimate resolution case court lower court remand case remanded applied rule reason analysis precise nature contract might bear whether restraint reasonable would nt bear question whether concerted activity involved guess point teams decided would rather negotiating individually either single licensee multiple licensees decided would negotiate collective potential licensee go collective rather individual teams central section one issue collective decided give contracts multitude potential bidders would affected fact concerted action involved would initial delegation authority would subject section one challenge would concerted action way court dagher said occurs point commissioner vested authority somehow plaintiff wanted say illicit concerted action teams agreed give commissioner general power would subject section one review seems would concerted action seems highly unlikely challenge would prevail applies carrying ordinary business league would apply commissioner running league office running individual teams say central point guess theory would first ask entity like entity compete respects think would ask first commissioner acting single entity exercises delegated authority making business judgment supplier buy paper wages answer yes section one inquiry case different challenge well get single business deciding whether buy paper one supplier several would nt subject section one review decision single business might affect welfare competitors would nt concerted action point think way position differs two parties one hand think logical implication petitioner position commissioner authority buy supplies league hire referees league ultimately derived consent individual teams independently owned logic petitioner position suggests would subject section one scrutiny hand logic nfl nfl position suggests commissioner set price decide buy paper behalf league jets giants could reach similar agreement jets giants could agree prices pay secretaries think follows logically position one entity copperweld instance court noted coordination different divisions single company would subject section one scrutiny implies divisions could get together two could confer among without raising section one concerns counsel seems last answers seem beg question start saying well obviously horizontal agreement among teams explain going analyze thought question us whether sorts rules regulations horizontal agreements teams whether part particular single entities articulation rules begging question part laughter counsel could articulate succinctly possible extent position departs position solicitor general well would thought transfer inefficiency lack clarity first question rule reason mean quite sure nt problem question want rest inefficiency confusion well thought purpose submission respond questions seen like scheduling like rules going game things seems odd subject rule reason analysis said well going easy case rule reason nt make sense sort carve outset rather end case thank mister mr nager mister mr stewart nt sorry nt mean interrupt answer following paper case saying teams delegated commissioner authority decide whether going enter whether league going enter one contract logo products let team decide would right well nt decision order paper one company rather another subject section one challenge mean office depot selling paper giants apply commissioner office part broader concerted entity separate saying well thirtytwo teams act individual entity group teams act individual entity thank counsel mister mr levy answer answer hypothetical mister mr levy ended law firm thank counsel case submitted interrupt question part burden argue multiple actors also agreement adverse effect competition understand nt part burden say procompetitive agreement concluded agreement overall effect stimulating additional procompetitive would equalize economic strength teams therefore made better competitors playing field would defense right said sure agreement burden plaintiff show agreement adverse effect competition understand facts revenue sharing nt share product sales joint product understand position could result case nt know whether district court right wrong rule reason issue one thing wondered record discussion briefs fact teams share revenues sales get record revenue sharing aspect different teams participation would would nt affidavit support conclusion basically procompetitive agreement tends make competition stronger playing field therefore sufficient defense rule reason end ball game yes competing regard sales paraphernalia forth competing among members league competing market includes sports paraphernalia assumes competition sales logos sales sports logos may ask question mister mr stewart would antitrust issue us different instead giving exclusive contract one purveyor product commissioner entered multitude different contracts specified minimum price every one specified fact exclusive agreement kind red herring case nt
