ms ms mitchell take position conduct voluntariness inquiry second statement warnings given agree think officer use initial confession get defendant admit went irrelevant voluntariness inquiry nt sufficient determine outcome position exactly relevant time relevant suppose soon officers got wanted mrs mrs seibert nt give twenty minute break cigarette said fine got going redo miranda rights nice slow go right questions significance time place room officers suppose one continuous episode middle gave miranda warnings mister mr mister mr gornstein miranda whatever become inform talking miranda nt inform nt inform gotten enough seems quite different thing anyone reading miranda decision says oh yes things police supposed say front saying nt really mean means nt inform rights somewhere midstream nt nt understand position point seems coercion first confession could could possibly relevant whether second confession voluntary whether prior admission nt say control could possibly relevant unless saying relevant whether miranda observed nothing whether necessarily involuntary inviting courts say well would nt made second confession made first one unwarned miranda therefore second one also presumptively inviting course ca nt carry day one totality circumstances right reference back could cause could cause later statement involuntary know tends show prior statement later statement involuntary unless tends show irrelevant tends show way could bearing seems person would said heck already coughed may well may well think makes second one involuntary well nt think either nt nt see relevant said totality circumstances always thought meant totality relevant circumstances know whether tuesday afternoon honorable court adjourned tomorrow ten oclock say reference back ms ms mitchell mean interrogator refers back earlier statement reserving time ms ms well mister mr gornstein hear thank mister mr gornstein ms ms bartholow correct hear thank ms ms mitchell case submitted clear seems absolutely right track saying miranda one basic purposes dealing cases may may compulsion sure gets rid risk good way describing seems kind case two risks one risk really compelled first statement second risk really first statement lead second confession obviate risks would make sense say case police knowingly reasonably known supposed give miranda warnings first case use second statement government shows first first one nt compelled second shows miranda warning given second third shows time elapsed sufficient make miranda warning reasonable reasonably cutting causal connection want cut right provide tremendous incentive police run around miranda warning run around could get back enough circumstances miranda bad circumstances called miranda may interrupt say second warning removes presumption earlier unwarned statement going forward going backward still presumption earlier statement involuntary true conversation warnings includes interrogation said would would affect officer said hour ago told x correct saying would permissible may ask broader question anything submission correct reason police department adopt policy said never give miranda warnings suspect confesses got lose understand nt confess anyway nt lost anything would nt confessed miranda warning confess got shot getting giving miranda warning would would always adopt may ask whether comment one required second warning include statement realize said would inadmissible trial mister mr gornstein making different compelled inquiry asking whether warned statement compelled asking every case whether earlier statement compelled police policy always refusing give warning say well nt question eight nine hours something like run risk compulsion seems going get factual inquiry respect earlier statement miranda designed prevent avoid respect later statement agree inadmissible earlier one compelled oh misunderstood assuming clear evidence first statement merely presumptively compelled actually compelled would automatically follow second would inadmissible get rule asking factor gets back question want ask think bears telling justice stevens tell relevance weight significance attach earlier unwarned statement factor totality circumstances telling us difficulty argument premise state accepting premise state second interrogation falls heels first think twenty minute break really separated matter simple psychology difficulty accepting plausibility conclusion ostensible waiver second case really free waiver distinct sort throwing one hands saying late say basic implausibility case offer point elstad mean let maybe way focused case elstad let say systematic questioning sort went police indeed engage kind firstround interrogation intensity pressure get answers case seems qualitatively different elstad comparatively speaking think maybe relatively easy tell elstad going serious issue seems order litigate issue threshold issue determining whether second waiver part litigation whether ostensible waiver really waiver second statement really voluntary right back morass litigation one principal objects miranda avoid first place said look litigation difficult difficult engage litigation produce clear reliable answer seems position take forces us right back litigation position tried get away miranda want us wade deeper absolutely right easy way way would make difficult way would promote litigation would nt simply closer interrogation less likely fact voluntary waiver simply mean question crucial element decision made appreciation legal rights crucial element decision waive voluntary seems closer prior statement closer saying got left waive sure go ahead already done function knowledge law function proximity prior statement know know common phrase think sleep phrase likely make intelligent decision time nt true mister mr please finish answer mister mr gornstein answer finished giving think throughout argument making think making assumption two inquiries made situation envision one voluntariness first statement unwarned statement second voluntariness second statement following warnings agree third inquiry voluntariness waiver okay nt think situation presented kind case purposes judging voluntariness waiver nt think situation presented kind case significantly different situation presented elstad elstad involve systematic interrogation nt fairly true say general rule following systematic interrogation less likelihood truly voluntary waiver right silence elstad situation trying keep simpler grant compulsion risk greater suggesting without get question making final determination whether going label first statement subject compulsion nt fact systematic interrogation case like fact makes less likely likely miranda waiver comes voluntary waiver getting question three talking question two likelihood voluntary waiver got got touch base ask question compulsion
