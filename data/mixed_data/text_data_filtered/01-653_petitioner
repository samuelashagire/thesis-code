like automatic cancellation mean fcc fcc appeared treat much like bankruptcy claim quite time nt mister mr clement respondent also makes righttocure argument bankruptcy law nt addressed take briefs anyway something nt fully grasp argument first say fully automatic cancellation license nt pay license gone say extend time want use discretion well automatic argument seems war discretion argument mister mr franklin nt congress provide exception perishable commodities department agriculture nonbankruptcy overriding concern one example congress responded saying bankruptcy provision nt going prevail may stop hypothetical thought nt get license till make payment yes nt license mister mr clement suppose consider classic case provision bankruptcy code directed suppose state law says anyone default traffic tickets amount dollar five hundred shall license revoked okay person question goes bankruptcy nt pay dollar five hundred gets dollar five hundred discharged bankruptcy state think revoke license nt regulatory purpose always find regulatory purpose mean easiest thing world always mechanism whenever debtor creditor creditor always extend payment need special power state making regulatory purpose regulator mean regulator creditor always say done regulator always think really legal issue whether discretion mean people say nt discretion well decide case nt realize one issues presented may important issue know billion dollars involved right well might mean assuming case one questions presented frankly nt want decide question one things given lot attention sounds know least quite arguable whether ought authority agree dispute means nt decide presented case look reasons mean troubles language statute simply says governmental unit may revoke charter franchise similar grant okay goes solely person debtor blah blah nt made payment solely let assume federal statute makes discrimination failure hire someone let say let say killing someone solely race crime separate crime someone let assume kills someone jewish said well nt kill solely jewish killed disagree policies israel get statute oh made getting question whether fact motive eliminates sole causality reason person killed jewish also reason license terminated person nt paid may regulatory motive background hypothetical invented international political motive background nt alter fact person killed solely jewish
