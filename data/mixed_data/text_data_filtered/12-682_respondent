could amend answer answers us could amend answer say anything somebody could person could diary records every place person ever gone last year theoretically possible could say something realistic analogue predigital era similar problem similar problem jones gps gps case rule law established predigital era apply digital era asked apply digital era technology changes lot things close analogue digital era something would allowed predigital era may different story counsel one court decisions past series justices asked noted many rules based practical considerations practically speaking person carry much person different carrying billfold photographs billfold photographs know anywhere one five generally much talking potentially thousands digital cameras people take endless photos spans entire life nt see difference two things become impractical gps gps follow people way prior following police officers cars nt permit way would assume need operate phone set bomb police phone bomb going set could ask could ask question extent theory talking smartphones minicomputers theory would apply ipads computers anything example sitting next person car desk arrested desk anywhere carrying hand see lot people carrying ipad something comparable tablet sort theory would permit search things putting let stop making argument brief three related questions okay ca nt put phone airplane mode yes confusing nt searched scene wipe going happen enough time precinct put airplane mode wipe nt happened little confused argument either scene protect phone station enough time get warrant putting airplane mode nt disagree put airplane mode nt disagree asking us constitutional principle based technology might might something one cases general court make rule particular case category cases think justice kagan pointed nervous concern take offense like failing buckle even driving influence gang crimes case rule cell phone fair game matter crime matter relatively unimportant crime misdemeanors misdemeanors opens world police well would rule saying person suppose car holder suppose passenger seat saying nt want express opinion want talk somebody pocket mister mr dreeben understanding time get warrant seize phone secure phone could go magistrate within hour get permission search reason cutting magistrate instrument going danger police taken disabled nt understand cut warrant picture think inverted two three willing limit willing limit position searches either order protect officer order preserve evidence number three order find evidence crime arrest willing limit way would say whatever person search gets arrest know wearing seat belt seems absurd able search person iphone able search person iphone avoid say look vast majority cases going problem unless officer reasonably looking evidence crime arrest cover bad cases wo nt cover know seat belt arrest mister mr dumont argument government solicitor general principal argument person arrested anything person arrested driving without seat belt police could take phone could look every single email person written including work emails including emails family members intimate communications could look person bank records could look person medical data could look person calendar could look person gps gps find every place person recently person arrested driving without seat belt strikes different kind world kind world describing somebody pictures family billfold nt strike way nt know marginal case argument solicitor general principal argument applies arrest applies everything cell phone people carry entire lives cell phones marginal case world live nt well mister mr dumont guess trying suggest call marginal fact people carry lives cell phones grow every single year know young people take world laughter mean marginal case computers much computing capacity laptops five years ago everybody certain age let say forty everything well suppose carrying laptop backpack well nt understand mister mr dumont everything mister mr dumont mister mr dumont guess nt understand said could mean everything could reduced piece paper bank records could medical records could happen mean would absolutely everything would nt well think notion could get legally way never justified illegal search otherwise mister mr dumont saying essentially nobody expectation privacy somebody dramatically reduced expectation privacy anything person actually wants keep times words one keep one cell phone home expectation privacy ask question mister mr dreeben given variety things cell phones seems though know sounds good limiting principle ends imagine every case police could really look everything give example sort like case somebody arrested gun crime going look various things might related gun crime whether bought guns whether know whether done searches gun stores emails might something say something gun possession gun purchase might photographs gun know whole range things could relate crime could nt well would looking things whole idea warrant neutral magistrate tells look things opportunity limit whatever way neutral magistrate feels appropriate protection three possibilities possibility one smartphone get warrant unless exigent circumstances possibility two yes like piece paper find pocket possibility three sometimes yes sometimes right three mean three choices mean call first choice never except exigent without warrant always nt need warrant three somewhere three choices okay get follow question follow question please tell inbetween rule rule sometimes say sometimes say kind thing police could searched nt computer search computer since search everything pockets nt computer nt everything mean way nt know whether call going turn evidence trash box wherever put nt know nt know til read guess saying thought category two sometimes really category three always wrong gives time think way gps gps information nt want admit wife might put little note pocket steven remember turn right third stoplight proceed three blocks forward course could looked information showed going long paper gps gps rule help analogue photos arrested person photos predigital age course look phone photos absolutely analogous except ten thousand indeed entire life history photos rule policeman look photos analogue ten thousand okay answer way understand going think things find analogue predigital age searches problem almost instances quantity far afield likely going rule couple states rule ca nt search michigan think vermont instance states scenarios taken place nt know take nt know right nt problem might postponed warring technologies et cetera saying allow searches cell phones might technology nt yet fact used states rule sounds little hypothetical quite sure handle saying resting discretion officer leads next question well get warrant well let leave let leave exigent circumstances easy case arguing exigent circumstances seems order try give answer justice kagan concerns maybe distinction ought serious nonserious offenses offenses nt think exists jurisprudence correct wrong well quite accurate would robinson rule attorney briefcase nt present exact problem every cell phone nt think quite works referring nt think quite works well tax return cell phones tax returns tax return jaywalker looking crime ever basis generality safety concern case certainly phone exploded phone used trigger device anything like general case question bomb sorry justice kagan question significant concession part nt smartphones carry lot information would sort thing police could look gps gps tracking information police could never gotten saying protected gps gps would see fact turn right thing gone somewhere else thank counsel mister mr dreeben cases happened go ahead please thank counsel four minutes mister mr fisher
