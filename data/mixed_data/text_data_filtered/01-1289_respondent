counsel looks like instruction jury said defendant may found guilty conspiracy charged indictment joined conspiracy time possible achieve objective conspiracy instruction given government position two ways conspiracy end one know case nt succeed government says conspirators abandon becomes impediment completion abandonment one person withdraws conspiracy tells police example tells coconspirators impediment another impediment nt stop conspiracy persisting ninth circuit thought pretty clearly said yes nt rather sharp disagreement among ninth circuit judges nt treat question sufficiency evidence mister mr dreeben said variance whether joined eighteenth nineteenth question join make difference defendants nt know seizure guilt turn factor far concerned truck gotten government surveillance says conspiracy began date says defendants became member nt say date defendants became member suppose suppose case truck apprehended arizona neither participants point cooperated police except tell police instructions drive truck certain place without government intervention calling recio buddy recio codefendant show without government intervention government seizure case scenario plays arranged without government intervention case would say conspiracy continued people properly prosecuted making turn government part bringing latecomers would impossibility caused government different impossibility caused somebody else want reframe think could answer question still find clients impossibility simpliciter impossibility produced government nt impossibility well terminated terminated people nt write notes saying know let call conspiracy terminated ninth circuit found object longer possible thought found terminated public danger presented people band together rob bank even money bank utterly impossible right quite different unquestionable fact public danger presented people band together curse somebody voodoo doll say well know harmless conspiracy conspiracy rob bank harmless bad people nt bank may another bank acknowledge conspiracy even though criminal conspiracy even though money bank right say criminal conspiracy reason money bank government removed money bank knowing going breakin government took money bank would different money outset well cases thought money bank one case wrong never money bank blood bank okay second case money bank government anticipating robbery removed say something different second case okay nt think either ninth circuit said argument making basis ninth circuit held conviction could nt stand thought simply know whether enticed mere fact mere fact longer possible execute conspiracy enough would follow would also true project impossible outset right mean nt understand say enter conspiracy rob bank money prosecuted right well know say well nt violate principle say harm done either much concrete harm could done except harm wicked people banding together crime conspiracy directed make different difference whether impossibility exists outset whether whether occurs later scheme make difference nt think assuming cruz right well mister mr shurtliff question presented petition certiorari whether conspiracy ends matter law government frustrates objective say going deal question well government formulated question part question court question court whether conspiracy ends matter law government frustrates objective whether might grounds ninth circuit might decided us nt proceed thank mister mr shurtliff mister mr dreeben three minutes remaining raised question ninth circuit words go ninth circuit say apply cruz period go ninth circuit reasons okay wanted know whether wanted know whether raised anything beyond cruz point answer yes reason trying get b c form conspiracy deprive person civil rights rob bank commit act terrorism whatever january one march march government agent infiltrates fail april three people join right law three people guilty anybody else facts case said think guilty okay guilty joined facts say guilty join infiltration government agent made absolutely certain would success right different facts us take say number one take hypothetical say government government different hypothetical government got joined true hypothetical oh led see government led three extra people join saying like entrapment quite strong entrapment argument government joined thereby frustrating objective addition brings circumstances later membership b three extra people take place close enough entrapment plus fact conspiracy ca nt exceed ca nt succeed put two things together grounds convicting argument right case like mix like impossibility entrapment mix argument ridiculing argument trying understand interesting argument may ask instructions jury papers us yes instructions petition means jury must found evidence sufficient say joined impossibility occurred government object instruction know ask another question conceivable jury found evidence impossibility sufficient sustain verdict nt asked find mean nt understand mister mr dreeben argument plenty evidence later joined joined ongoing conspiracy charge nt ask find maybe mister mr dreeben comment rebuttal relied cruz cruz said extends court said extends conspiracy liability beyond reasonable limits say continues product longer delivered remains new recruit added reason given cruz must legal doctrine rests upon impossibility entrapment two categories know something else well nt nt know confusing people criminal intent join conspiracy intent violate law called conspirators nt sound like rocket science well think defendant defendants could charged new conspiracy seems undercuts argument thought whole purpose argument reasonable confines long conspiracy exist everybody knows going go forward say second conspiracy could happen trial judge faithfully followed cruz cruz jury found liable say cruz wrong still go back new trial page seventysix find guilty conspiracy joined prior one eighteen hand find larger conspiracy find guilty larger conspiracy must distribute drugs seized suppose proof nt support either conspiracies happens think instruction wrong evidence defendants convicted cruz wrong still send back assuming cruz right assuming cruz wrong would seem evidence fully sufficient convict cruz wrong nt make difference joined one eighteen laughter
