well could give example state administrative proceedings would fall within understanding scope younger well suppose licensing procedure somebody denied license barber hairdresser person wants challenge federal court would younger apply well suppose administrative agency state hears appeals correct eighth circuit law party wants bring federal lawsuit go state court first well thought thought sprint said go state court whether wanted else would nt able go federal court seems counsel left colorado river view case mean colorado river made clear abstention exception always thought driving principle federal law announced federal courts take eighth circuit rule everything unitary required rule time involves state agency essentially subject abstention left federal courts jurisdiction well eighth circuit decided question right nt say nt get essence question state law interpreting federal law mimics federal law nt derive power independent federal law way abstention doctrines take care state interests nt burford many others nt know younger following justice scalia question younger vehicle need create categories nopsi nopsi protect state interests awful lot doctrines already way ever used younger abstention case federal plaintiff also filed federal state action well anybody court board saying every state agency adjudication attended state court review yeah would apply two cases middlesex dayton say case belongs younger category state court adjudication state agency adjudications attended state court review would fall outside younger rationale younger covers well would nt say sprint initiator state process sprint withdrew complaint right sprint sprint withdrew complaint yes point becomes board proceeding becomes proceeding initiated board sprint nt counsel especially cases involve jurisdictional issues seems awfully awful waste counsel time client money litigating court ought seems avoid lines ought clear nt seem line know whether significant state interest involved clear line argue almost case disinclined use kind test along others ca nt limit limit younger abstention three categories discussed nopsi nopsi say purely civil case raises kind issue arguably subject younger abstention right think guess mister mr lynch concern given think agencies things implicate important state interests time test test eighth circuit tests would turn agency adjudicators primary legal decisionmakers system matters know wanted get including matters federal law seem like big proposition know mean think younger says middlesex says ever said matter purely federal law mean think civil case involving state one side private parties another state court jurisdiction federal laws state claims defendant violated civilly federal statute action also federal court view federal court abstain action injunction want judge decide case private party wants federal judge decide case matter interpreting federal law opinion younger younger doctrine younger require abstention yes okay review never case proceed federal court even purely federal issue fact involving estate civil case question yes well ca nt think nt often happen cases mean would think would nt difficult mean either never one tend right whole lot tend wrong never heard put extreme way maybe right nt know authority light shed younger say younger say said view nt matter brought first guess younger applies state proceedings brought first guess could criminal defendant yet one bring action federal court say law unconstitutional something violates federal law state prosecutes criminally federal court could nt federal court could enjoin criminal proceeding said ca nt enjoin criminal decision criminal proceeding state court long criminal proceeding nt brought first court said pending one time get around mean ask clarify come couple rules strike counterintuitive trying figure one one nt seem work well mind would seem know could nt federal court could nt federal court could enjoin criminal proceeding came later view guess right mean different category normal regulatory interests important regulatory interests mean seems line younger drew thought drawing criminal civil eroded considerable extent friend analogized cases want better word sort quasicriminal least touching upon process opposed particular proceeding mean think abstention applies case every regulatory proceeding well tell sorry going oh well nt sort like important state interests assume state anything unless think important type administrative proceeding remedial otherwise bite something going happen nt tell sense mean almost every administrative proceeding coercive well point nt seem like much limiting test say time sort time anything bad happen result administrative proceeding coercive nt seem like serious constraint application younger sorry going say presumably state resolving dispute pursuant state law state regulation state policy nt know state interest unimportant simply resolution private dispute thank counsel mister mr simeone six minutes remaining
