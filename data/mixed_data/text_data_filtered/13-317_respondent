let let give example let pretend juror kentucky capital case let assume case prosecution puts evidence show eligibility evidence aggravating factors defense puts evidence mitigation judge tells shall consider mitigating extenuating facts circumstances presented evidence believe true okay instruction number four assume nt objection judge gives instruction requested defendant compelled testify fact defendant testify prejudice way back jury room say well consider mitigating evidence know lot things could mitigating capital case like know defendant childhood like know whether defendant abused like know whether defendant remorseful nt heard anything nt know judge told consider mitigating evidence presented hand judge told failure fact defendant nt put mitigating evidence ca nt prejudice way supposed nt really says fact nt testify could testified child childhood remorse things nt prejudice way well tell supposed juror judge says consider evidence put fact defendant nt put evidence form testimony nt prejudice way pulled two different directions nt know well may show prosecutor nt think going make difference raise objection could create everything happened since something nt going make difference case incredibly heinous crime prosecutor may thought jury going return verdict want anyway even instruction given nt think possibility think worse adverse inference might drawn nothing zero equals zero zero ca nt added onto taken away zero zero positive negative ca nt take away zero create evidence silence ca nt silence outweigh aggravating circumstances correct could prosecutor argue would put scale courts cases specific issue attention nt called suggested nature affirmative defense defendant burden persuade jury mitigators defendant nt say sorry anything else defendant produce anything else way remorse curious one facet case instruction sought defendant prosecutor objection judge said sorry going use instruction common kentucky parties agree instruction given judge says going give could let assume right error could harmful given mitigators aggravators dispute entered guilty plea defendant harmed failure give instruction nt demonstrate anything sort means nt object maybe bad lawyer knows going determine law basis whether government lawyer made objection shows nt think anything wrong mean think nothing wrong okay trying help counsel remorse nt remorse issue well whatever mean jury nt take account nt one one factors right go beyond saying believe say prevail believe reasonable juror reasonable jurist could possibly believe otherwise want say reasonable jurors could say otherwise think made difference jury would condemned client death fact drew adverse inference knew horrific details crime heard mitigating evidence think tipped balance least think plausibly could tipped balance failure give noadverseinference instruction really well well estelle might overruled caveat mitchell puts caveat remorse remorse might different question nt caveat suggest least instruction asked broad went beyond court decided instruction asked distinguish remorse issues going come jury sentencing phase least seems instruction sort blows question reserved sorry issue hearing would seem cut strongly mister mr komp remorse issue hearing remorse thing mitchell said decided clearly established law rely appreciate mitchell rather mitchell suggests always question whether estelle applied remorse mister mr komp sixth circuit apply wrong harmlessness standard seemed apply standard would applicable direct review rather habeas review correct seems rely primarily carter carter applies chapman standard course direct review standard low iq iq personality disorder take mitigating factors case witnesses says two mitigating factors low iq iq personality disorder says nothing jurors go room decide low iq iq personality disorder weight give mitigators instruction says jurors nt take account fact testify jurors perfectly clear would think think difficult friend raised true carter instruction refers guilt took instruction word word cut guilt nothing guilt right estelle says would think right carter instruction respect sentencing factors namely future dangerousness last sentence page mitchell says deciding whether entitled instruction respect sentencing fabricators namely remorse question thing sentence remorse mitchell nt least ambiguous whether client entitled instruction response say said gathered record best able see sentencing hearing know pretty well okay five matters issue low iq iq personality disorder child troubled home grown poverty sexually abused right things basically factual matters background context instruction carter instruction without word guilt referring failure testify nt mention five things specifically nt say testify five things context anything else hearing jury could thought failure testify referred anything else juror might thought oh nt testify thing thing thinking thinking issue case whether instruction top whatever problems broad thinking issue issues instruction could thought referring nt get breadth matter ask something else hearing jury might thought oh nt testify got point answer terms facts hearing remorse issue hearing answer still nt answer justice alito dilemma say ca nt penalized nothing juror justice alito hypothetical says supposed nt present anything concerned nt think answered question suppose read estelle saying issue remorse open question whether selfincrimination privilege applicable suppose read way suppose think case remorse issue penalty phase mean issue clearly decided bearing case suppose read mitchell saying remorse issue settled whether fifth amendment selfincrimination right settled defendant entitled instruction silence number one number two suppose think think case remorse issue trial penalty phase mean rule unclear clearly entitled instruction issue answer law question whether least law open point unsettled well reservation certainly suggests time instruction requested nt beyond fairminded dispute standard one talked standard yet standard complaining error well understood comprehended existing law beyond possibility fairminded disagreement seems shortly instruction requested court said oh different talking certainly suggests subject fairminded disagreement position must clear beyond fairminded disagreement right well saying clear objectively beyond reasonable disagreement say court says lack remorse sentencing guideline case still thinks different rule lack remorse selection case thought friend told us future dangerousness eligibility factor rather mere selection criteria sorry left estelle left intact argument mitchell said whether applies lack remorse acceptance responsibility sentencing guidelines separate question nt view time court said well course applies context perfectly clear mean arguing way would say well question whether clearly clear difference lack remorse sentencing guideline case lack remorse capital case everybody knew mitchell said nt apply lack remorse sentencing guidelines nobody would think meant open issue capital context finish thank counsel ms
