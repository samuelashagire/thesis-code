compare another process fda fda looks closely think even closely new devices new drugs new drugs also go long testing period fda fda gives approval drug marketed turns risks people nt understand tort suit defense manufacturer followed letter permission fda fda gave would certainly least right compliance federal law would defense merits reason understand tort suits preempted respect new drugs reason treat two differently new medical devices new drugs difference question express preemption provision mean take take concrete situation fda fda asked like make improvement fda fda says nt think enhances safety tort suit based failure make improvement would nt fda fda rejection permission make improvement would nt least preemptive thought response would nt go jury fda fda said make plaintiff point must make order make device safe thought answer fda fda regulation fda fda action refusing allow change made would preemptive would nt give jury secondguess determination fda fda asking matter federal law fda fda says rejects proposed change state court say well think fda fda wrong rejecting going let go jury thought question posing nt federal law preemptive situation fda fda says ca nt personal injury lawyer wants convince jury another variation fda fda says must include x device wo nt give premarket approval manufacturer puts x lawsuit wants charge putting x made device dangerous would fda fda insistence x put take x state court tort litigation would nt fda fda says must state court could nt put jury whether eliminated label pressing said really nt know design defect label would thing manufacturer wants make call improvement simply market product improvement without fda fda action even designed improve safety effectiveness right devices grandfathered specifically approved safe effective fda fda right state requirement mean federal requirement simply device market law became effective right yeah well point follow justice kennedy question point fda fda lohr never made determination weighing risks benefits issuance pma pma jury replowing ground fda fda already plowed lohr mean food drug regulation states issue regulations contradict federal approval talking drugs medical devices say well mean comply additional go comply state rule conflict easy states issue regulations go beyond beyond fda fda says drug matters would surprised case basis conflict conflict okay medical devices act add additional requirements long suppose regulation long additional requirement dos prevent complying federal requirements long conflict states add additional requirements medical devices act understanding field preemption nt well way would jury say mean fact fact going could safe made change fda fda rejected case goes jury fact going trial know made change would safe nt make change therefore ladies gentlemen jury hold company liable theory case look jury verdict decide whether basis jury made decision state law nt say federal preemption requires say grace new york state may situation new york state change law far concerned right new york state let go jury despite despite fda fda done said simply defense new york state law law states nt defense new york state law thought point justice ginsburg implying course little unrealistic though expert agency state conducted scientific inquiry decided something safer fda fda approved negligent issue fda fda approved going simply one jury decided judgment safer device used judgment one jury manufacturer placed risk selling device scientists fda fda said okay find extraordinary thought something little different question might helpful answer serious helped knowing specific design defect claim respect catheter like refer details catheter respect material shape catheter plaintiff think designed defectively tell know must theory design saying safe ca nt go court without mind counsel kind specific thing wrong catheter using words design mean designed badly part design right saying material balloon different material different thickness right mean design something burst nt know design balloon basing design claim let tell asked question nt want leave leave unfavorable impression mind issue without chance see worrying course terrible thing somebody hurt kinds accidents lawyers trying help lawyers think look problem must client seriously hurt supposed work backward say well hurt must something wrong design every time accident something bad happens lawyers assert design claim gear discovery mind could congress intended kind thing trying group experts really look decide whether marketed bothering would like respond well decision reached let ask state law either generally specifically law state trying invoke jury finder fact weigh potential risks injury illness probable benefits health patient one things jury words suppose important device one percent risk jury consider determines whether negligently sold alright nt exactly fda fda measured pma pma process fda fda specifically charged weighing risks probable benefits jury thing fda fda well expedited five ten k different pma pma pma pma specific weight medtronic free alter label without fda fda consent citation nt situation addressed requirement manufacturer alert fda fda new information least file annual reports fda fda pull back premarket approval think problems require right thought theory little nuanced words nt require market particular catheter understood arguing may better design negligent manufacturer market particular design even though allowed nt made change make safer right well well happens going happen patients time theory comes manufacturer looks says well maybe better device nt want risk tort suits going stop selling old device approved got get fda fda approval new device might take forever least year let say happens patients year got device theory although device approved better one negligent manufacturer part market device even though approved fda fda better one would reduce risks want think negligent market approved product nt want take market reasonably safe another design would safer think basis negligence say yeah fda fda approved nt mean required manufacturer market device like car speedometer mean speedometer goes one twenty miles hour nt mean supposed drive fast thank counsel mister mr olson
