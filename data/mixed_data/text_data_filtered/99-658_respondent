relationship set economic incentives makes look costs well health separation issue one even assuming right hard believe respect cost incentives congress nineteen seventythree wrote hmo hmo act congress provided incentives encourage hmo hmo throughout erisa erisa without saying anything wanted gut hmo hmo legislation start put front want know theory nt achieve result find hard believe congress wanted saying think example group people look child time born time dies get interested incentives called preventive care end lot less disease doctors pay attention patients across board also tell doctors nt use expensive treatment look actually benefit patient throughout cost life whole course life take theory underlies kinds cost incentives built plan congress nt congress make judgment hmo hmo similar kinds judgments asking theory asking theory many hmo hmo fall pattern physicianowned said thought way idea many nt many doctors presumably ca nt afford hire independent administrator mean going small organization mister mr ginzkey nt get response justice breyer question difference make whether separation let assume doctors nt make decisions organization makes decisions long organization incentive keeping costs would nt organization fall prey complaint make nt nothing distinct doctors making complaint whoever making decision treatment ought given financial incentive necessarily coincident best interests patient going case whether doctor somebody line long kind hmo hmo say bring somebody doctors somebody doctors financial interest whole enterprise hire firm make medical decisions whether get operation firm owning doctors hmo hmo also financial interest whole enterprise well nt know well supposing hire said supposing small group doctors hires administrator administrator administers claims doctors tell know allowing lot stuff nt think allow result income going result well giving hypothesis put hypothesis wish would respond would respond little directly well difference perhaps degree difference degree finesse nt end day nt operative fact hmo hmo interest hmo hmo interest every employee whether hmo hmo whether doctor nondoctor administrator hold health cost unless hmo hmo going go business seems interest whether stark shape takes whether subtle shape takes hypothesis right interest seems equally interest case odds fiduciary duty nt see interest subtle case nt equally odds fiduciary duty know mechanism make difference say wrong mechanism induces socalled fiduciaries say care mechanism operating perhaps less obvious level inherent hmo hmo nt see mechanism makes difference effect rule decision want us come think got draw lines say breach fiduciary duty clear doctors get yearend payment make decision however breach fiduciary duty least cognizable one interest denying coverage ultimate compensation subtle rule decision want right order nt asking us rule decision something like put suppose may good answer exactly track take separate person want know somebody nothing doctors works erisa erisa trust plan company person says plan going going take bunch doctors going pay three thousand three hundred dollars per patient per year say doctors take patients tell money nt spend keep right rule sort bothering rule want would outlaw rule said nt know see rule draws strength fact know group ethical rules governing medicine doctors believe governed take three thousand three hundred dollars try look best way saving patient anyway little saving extra money benefit rule sounded okay maybe true maybe role sounds abolishes rule well think attributed meaning word unduly extremely vague questionnaire say well take answer saying thought good legal rule nt nt mind decide also make unlawful erisa erisa rule talked three thousand three hundred dollars per patient going distinguish right tell maybe said already sorry asking repeat distinction precisely one one want well mister mr ginzkey courts get slippery slope problem posing us congress designed scheme built private furnishing health care health maintenance organizations privately owned inherently incentives keep costs hmo hmo order provide care make pay scheme congress authorized served doctors ethical obligations treatment patients suppose congress relied ability enforcement ethical obligations curb otherwise might appear unfortunate financial incentive cut costs courts get involved messy business deciding scheme undue infringement nt ask question asked opponent beginning case really stake client case stage recoup plan would money accumulated would get fund would go back hmo hmo would go thought suing behalf behalf plan well let little confused presentation talked coverage determinations understand occurred denial coverage client acknowledged suffering covered plan complaint got procedure whereas procedure b expensive nt give b cost nt right get coverage determination question even involved case nt consider right okay say kind treatment would expensive right thought explain something else would hmo hmo contracted state farm mutual would get money doctors pay money hmo hmo would nt get doctors risk pool forgive stupidity risk pool fund money owns insurance company property plan asset well would physically supposing get money actually gets title goes back hmo hmo well qualifies representative people risk pool mister mr ginzkey may go back answer justice scalia telling case said malpractice case coverage case denial benefits case resulting kind harm mean malpractice case know harm coverage case exactly harm harm simply risk pool smaller otherwise would basically making financial management claim saying misapplying funds well know assume may come back followup question assuming know case mismanagement funds case right order think assuming right order make case mismanagement funds necessary us accept proposition whenever physician hmo hmo strong financial incentive make medical decision medical decision therefore fiduciary decision therefore therefore claim preempted state malpractice law favor erisa erisa fiduciary law median term nt median term order get result kind decision involved case nt mean nt understanding claiming kind decision crucial claim case saying happens coincidence bringing financial mismanagement claim joined pleadings happen make malpractice claims saying blue even client lived totally healthy life never denied immediate appendectomy could bring claim mere coincidence happen context case okay nt realize nt realize making erisa erisa claim thought making state claims reason comes objection count iii iii count iv iv state claims preempted erisa erisa appear amended count iii iii actually client appendectomy irrelevant malpractice irrelevant nothing entirely mean going come either fiduciary issue fiduciaries figure standard incentives could extreme violate obligation everybody basically view standard determining whether concede incentive plans could okay standard determining think government concedes could nt okay right know got lot agreement got laughter view difference standard okay okay right would draw
