nato nato meeting laughter could send secretary state fact think smarter anyway laughter president says top secret ca nt tell judge ca nt question laughter law would govern state law nice presidents law would control federal state president says ca nt something connected office decides asking decides court decide whether president interfered much simple assertion simple assertion president willing take political heat say nt enough time come hearing would allow absolutely control ca nt leave political pressures take care president going ten times going look bad view interference suppose example lawyers deposing nonwhite house witnesses turns every statement made newspaper president says respond saying certain place certain time said something somebody month ago somebody else says something nt say somebody says something paper somebody wrote goes know things work suppose president says look nt time go things nt time remember every single thing said everybody anything tangentially related interfering right view interference given example interference saying deposition depositions interfere nt time interference comes says view decided repeating question want clear side example takes dozens depositions one turns call peripheral satellite issues said paper nt forth says nt time talk lawyers details many require much thought claim interference view supposed work well nt defend judgment court appeals file crosspetition certiorari ground court permitted understand discovery go forward take position discovery may go forward president asserts gee taking time deposing witness x state arkansas consuming time look therefore hook position precisely told justice breyer rule thing asserting totally confused depositions third parties state president comes says look want keep track stuff need meet lawyer want see going interfering duties lower court goes beyond question understand let answer justice oconnor question go ahead trial court judge state court level determine whether offer complaint made president lawyer made good faith nt know inevitable suit like argument today taking hour counsel participants argument thought least weekend week laughter anxiety component intellectual commitment emotional commitment far extensive time chart would indicate think part president saying going defend lawsuit absorb substantial energies well president attorney came court cert stage asserted petition certiorari causing president spend much time supreme court lay bothering duties interested issue taking time supreme court united states fact issue law consuming great deal time effort anxiety thought issue good faith thought said moment ago fact particular objection particular deposition whatnot made good faith would appropriate court honor period let showing inquiry goes good faith request goes thought saying goes good faith claim interference different thing think allowing thereby inquiry degree interference whether interference serious enough warrant stay whatnot think two different inquiries understood saying back responding justice breyer good faith inquiry would dispositive probably try take immunity context respect lesser officers know fitzgerald case featured briefs argument harlow came day case court said discovery peculiarly disruptive effective government case lesser officer reason court said although immunity qualified going decide question top list discovery allowed asked thought arguing conceding fact good faith assertion privilege given instance would appropriate honor wrong whatever call third party depositions talking may ask question regard third party depositions concerned impact office president forth would permissible trial judge trying control litigation recognize special problems president narrow discovery matters relate particular incident involved trial say ca nt ask history last ten years fortyfive police officers forth would permissible use trial judge discretion would permissible narrow discovery scope inquiry mister mr davis nt think answering questions quite frankly might hope would say trial judge could consider nt say whether bound difference president claim simply saying ca nt come conclusive court seems court obligation least permissible weigh court evaluation president claim think would like think colleagues would like answers questions holding eighth circuit reviewing sounds different read sixth eighth circuit opinion mister mr davis mister mr davis unlikely favor disposition allows judge federal state sit judgment president assertion whether executive duties important alternative proposal would draw distinction person president hauled court depositions people say latter worry trial like worry personal health financial affairs marital problems home whatever something got live even president however hauled personally judge something else give president absolute immunity makes claim busy come enter judgment simply refuses appear rest trial proceed would acceptable well president says saying rest trial saying subpoenaed testify says busy president united states make claim still insist court pass judgment president ca nt come compromise think court sit judgment whether indeed busy suffer judgment suffer judgment say president good faith make assertion privilege would honored good faith seems give away case leave two things court inquiry number one existence good faith number two whether risk presidency seems inquiries intrusive argues strongly absolute privilege petitioners suggesting mister mr davis risk taking account two things mister mr bennett said would appropriate take depositions perpetuate testimony danger testimony wo nt available later prevail get interest damage award stake postponement nt alleged anything like well witnesses memories also fade thought far witnesses memories concerned thought mister mr bennett conceded could something like rule twentyseven federal rules civil procedure depositions perpetuate testimony yes responding dim memory problem dim memory problem get current memory well sure even fitzgerald case justice powell footnote suggested congress might pass law authorizing claim president congress could pass law ca nt constitutional matter fitzgerald case justice powell said leaving leaving open possibility congress could away absolute immunity law mere law course congress apparently make constitutional statute otherwise unconstitutional commerce clause ca nt laughter even true would nt unheard strange jurisprudence true laughter fact true though true congress statute well congress gives power cause something otherwise would held court violate commerce clause violate constitution gives congress power regulate commerce nt give congress power regulate immunities suppose distinction well would federal immunity matter federal common law federal constitutional law well often true litigants always nt trust one another completely may ask question asked opponent long think take try case asking describe case asking tell long think take try would take four five days one major concerns course extent plan go collateral matters suppose parties involved ten days trial two working weeks pick number fifteen depositions think would substantial investment president time degree think entitled order deferring litigation something perverse incentive incentive ask long trial mister mr davis mister mr davis trust court make judgment trust court make specific judgments instancebyinstance basis think appropriate way ca nt also trust court make judgment front going many specific instances many specific instances going costly president practical thing make blanket judgment based upon good judgment trust court make first two kinds good judgments ca nt trust court make third kind well discretionary mean exercise court discretion instance trust first two examples concede third assuming evidentiary basis okay let assume president lawyers come provide one okay thing thing really arguing whether ought blanket rule invoked simply saying want deferral four years distinct rule president lawyers going come say practical stakes involved therefore justify four year continuance really arguing
