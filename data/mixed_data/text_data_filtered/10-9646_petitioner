could write opinion us would hold definition child purpose would hold ca nt sentence life imprisonment without parole anyone fifteen anybody fifteen would permissible tell us age line needs drawn constitutional purposes think logic argument leads would say seventeen person seventeen years ten months eleven months commits worst possible string offenses still demonstrates great maturity still sentenced life imprisonment without parole mean say addressed state law allows addressed legislators nt understand law permits nt really understand argument mean legislatures enacted laws nt realize laws person age eighteen may sentenced life imprisonment without parole murder nt understand think legislators nt understand laws provide nt contact tell realize state sixteen year old seventeen year old may sentenced life prison without parole murder say oh gosh never realized let change law made decision maybe bad decision really nt understand argue made decision aware law provides think difference state says expressly juvenile certain age may sentenced life imprisonment without parole state says person convicted capital murder sentence may imposed another another provision says juveniles may transferred prosecution adults difference two think legislators pennsylvania michigan nt understand laws provide sorry thought said second earlier bifurcated rule life without parole whatsoever fifteen mandatory life sixteen fifteen write opinion bifurcated rule justifies absolute ban certain age modified ban age deal harmelin respect second part rule harmelin says nt look individualized sentencing get rid mandatory going counsel question dealing much smaller universe children sentenced life without parole fourteen argument commit crimes putting aside universe rather small right much much larger group justice kennedy pointed life without parole juveniles fifteen go back question need answer assuming bifurcated theory proffered tell get around harmelin would write decision nt majority theory harmelin least three justices spoke gross disproportionality views life mandatory life without parole someone like juvenile grossly disproportionate happened jackson mister mr stevenson roper court also made point ruled death penalty said extent juvenile death penalty might residual deterrent effect worth noting punishment life imprisonment without possibility parole severe sanction court roper seemed anticipating case suggesting right constitutional would satisfy mandatory term left trier put put mitigating circumstances well could say reserve question another day mister mr stevenson may ask case question specifically miller case two boys involved horrendous crime older one took plea got life parole plea offered miller fifty years much well know depart principle enunciated death different life without parole categorically different sixty years seventy years know back next term sixty year sentence okay good change change question fifty years without possibility parole distinction right without fifteen years old fifteen sixty years fourteen seventy years distinction fourteen fifteen understand know draw lines ca nt basis historical tradition certainly common law left jury take account youthfulness offender entitled jury trial right even come decision consult preferences matter something like thirtynine states allow mean american people know decided rule allow federal government allows supposed impose judgment seems consensus american people well going help know well thought modern penology abandoned rehabilitation thing longer call prisons reformatories whatever punishment criterion deserved punishment crime criterion everything say irrelevant let assume nt believe rehabilitation think sentencing authorities nowadays federal state levels made clear instead striking laws states nt require state legislatures think right see many think come know something agrees nt agree would nt democratic somehow mister mr stevenson mister mr stevenson statistics many sentences imposed eighteen year olds nonmandatory states think would true going age eighteen eighty plus percent imposed states mandatory systems saying would unprincipled us say least unsupported us say sentence mandatory cases might still imposed take table leave us nothing saying sentence never permitted always permitted difficult statistics show two thousand three hundred prisoners sentence life without parole juvenile murders committed eighteen two thousand three hundred nationwide difficult assess answer justice alito oh legislatures nt know focus mandatory aspects case think know prefer general rule may general rule sure trial judge determine whether going give life without parole discretionary look get social scientists come tell chances rehabilitation statistics quite compelling stories rehabilitation case nt know isolated nt know statistical universe often rehabilitation demonstrated real look judge supposed well seems forcing us bipolar position either going say ca nt prevail everyone eighteen get life without parole nt see middle course seem abandoned ca nt tell judge would apply chose abandon idea many juveniles subject sentence life without parole plead lesser sentence right reason realize speculation would nt think prosecutors would view particularly attractive offer someone young sense may regard sentence extraordinary may particularly attractive someone young way would nt forty year old offer twentyfive years may attractive fifteen year old might also basis question statistics put forward often sentence actually imposed words evolving standards decency suggest prosecutors state may immune evolution either well statistics nt helpful idea particular cases whether perhaps older offender less less guilty sixteen seventeen fifteen year old thank mister mr stevenson mister mr neiman mean decision even argument states go back say look decision based fact nt think know law nt thought let hearing vote yes minimum age think sixteen whatever age constitutional rule change get thirty states saying look thought answer whether eighth amendment prohibits changes right one things take account societal consensus say ignore thirty whatever states allow nt really think postulating let make let see thought thank mister mr stevenson mister mr neiman case submitted mister mr chief justice may please court graham v issue graham involved juveniles convicted nonhomicide offenses deficits maturity judgment decisionmaking crimespecific children encumbered barriers court found constitutionally relevant imposition sentence life imprisonment without parole death penalty fact roper court acknowledged differences children adults exist even cases involving aggravated murders deficits differences even pronounced young children question justice ginsburg default sentence roper life imprisonment without parole actually think specifically regard provision greater deterrent effect deficits problems children experience lend analysis subject punishment life imprisonment without parole like death penalty court held graham justice scalia think absolutely right point term year sentence could constitute kind judgment life imprisonment without parole distinction obviously life imprisonment without parole term sentence sentences instances sentence extreme permit possibility release court held graham state forfeits ability incarcerate life yes well think would tough case think imposed juvenile fifty year sentence would create meaningful possibility release court ordered graham context would right line think fifty years would actually side meaningful possibility release would sort cynical reaction court say ban life without parole kinds offenders would somewhat problematic suggest going get close death possible facilitate kind review think interested think well think sentencing perspective sentences would problematic distinction fourteen year old fifteen year old constitutional purposes course younger compelling deficits distinctions well think well think well true course case justice scalia case discretion sentence neither judge jury could give effect age evan miller fourteen also think identified lots laws make distinctions provide greater responsibilities would satisfy justice ginsburg reasons court acknowledged graham problem many crimes offense overwhelm mitigating factors aspects juvenile decisionmaking think constitutionally permissible problem still ca nt make good judgments whether child whether characteristics transitory permanent think would principled kind strike mandatory sentences think constitutionally court recognized roper graham would mistake equate kids adults nt ability make judgments even create different kind process well nt mean take table mean

crime sort yes think yes think strength argument justice alito states actually considered discussed passed laws setting minimum age life without parole set minimum age fifteen primary argument thirteen states done except one set eighteen transfer question informs whether children subject sentences different question question whether juvenile system may mandate release age eighteen age twentyone adequate offender judgment child therefore subject life imprisonment without parole disconnect transfer judgments court recognized thompson graham proxies sentencing judgments different calculation second point minimum age trying children adults even prosecuting children adults think concede age life without parole sentence would constitutionally impermissible crime extent state nt

roper graham arguing life without parole disproportionate crime aggravated murder arguing status children deficits childhood status creates make kind judgment cruel well think one problems honor trying make judgments even psychologists say ca nt make good longterm judgments rehabilitation transitory character young people reason graham court nt permit kind discretion know well well think
