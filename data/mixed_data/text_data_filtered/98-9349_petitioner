client know terrible intrusion privacy easy way avoid called hard luggage really concerned privacy contents whatever carrying put hard luggage big second getting hard bag gets soft bag knows people going able feel things think fellow passengers sniff luggage okay nt think would invasion privacy mean say would nt said police police dogs sniff luggage right think would invasion privacy saw passenger moving laughter know moving one bags would consider invasion privacy think would know happen exposed put soft luggage expose put trash containers readily opened looked well would contend well nt contend aisle interstate bus public place purpose mean agent cantu perfect right aisle large brick ms ms fuentes record show well sure right ms ms fuentes mean supposing someone experience mister mr cantu retired government service simply pushing shoving without particular motive could discerned thing agent cantu could could nt mean respect purpose intent mean lot manipulation well ms ms fuentes mister mr lamken hear thank ms ms fuentes case submitted following problem fly quite lot boston forth put bags time upper thing people always moving around push lift move places soft would feel inside happens time frankly move somebody else bag push mine imagine interstate bus different happens time say client kind special expectation since experience people always handling soft luggage object different physically say happens occasionally one flight attendants maybe passenger take canvas bag holding move different compartment push around guess feel something physically happened different know know way might win say difference manipulation physically taking bag moving one place another way could win well ask one mean came thought well nt hard maybe harder real question whether put luggage place reasonable expectation somebody could go feel brick answer yes expectation answer right theory way answer must yes good chance somebody would feel brick unless requires special hard touch right sure agree justice scalia nt mean interrupt passenger first take bus case nt like airplane nt luggage nt go kind detector suppose much less expectation privacy airplanes buses agree person right tell someone else nt squeeze bag see find nt agree premise justice scalia question difference police officer fellow passenger justice breyer luggage case purpose manipulation touching bag see inside presume purpose passenger hand think difference law ignores ask subjective intention person touches bag something like objective purpose look think one differences law blind wrong well conclude previous question submit case proposition purpose search rather touching irrelevant right authority proposition degree manipulation point questions put justice stevens justice scalia seem passenger right start manipulating luggage see tort conversion asportation property assault inanimate thing ca nt assaulted sure although seems level wrong occurring well would agree passenger right tell policeman nt feel bag nt well florida bostick said police officer show authority two case fact guns forth said may search bag said passenger citizen exercise rights point passenger nt try stop right wanted assume making assumption suppose saying sure authority expectation privacy reinforced fact hand means protect nt availed means bostick comes seems case yes standing aisle nt point analogy feeling standing aisle least public extent bus passengers free person peeps window reasoning place person right nt go ahead okay seems going ask crucial standing nt draw line looking basically free feeling basically free different justice kennedy exactly question thinking purpose nt seem relevant mean inso relevant obviously fly plane look marijuana fields purpose search policeman peeping tom example justice scalia gave something different beg pardon expectation privacy change moment saw officer squeezing object relevant officer stood squeezing thing fifteen minutes said nothing would point able infer consent point alternatively would able say terms bus travel fact changed whatever original expectation may longer reasonable expectation privacy would valid line
