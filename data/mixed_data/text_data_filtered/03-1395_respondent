well think term subparagraph meant nineteen ninetyfive agree courts interpreted apply little one two ii nt believe said always said congress sometimes nt use sometimes make mistakes thought said generally way always way may stop thought could get actual damages nt first thing could prove actual damages get actual damages cases cases could nt prove actual damages appear somewhere papers citing okay going read close eyes listen laughter nothing wait want hear prove c read read would could nt c right getting back language nt talk points justice breyer raising purpose purpose would limit little one two would make sense reason would make sense right mister mr blankingship thought part response justice souter would nothing anomalous imposing dollar limit massive transactions imposing dollar limit smaller transactions precisely would expect congress need dollar limit home mortgages obvious need dollar limit smaller loans less obvious nt answer laughter never heard counsel refuse answer would like see happen laughter answer answer implication new statutory text means say means expressly repealed earlier one nt mean say means guess implication means say means implication statutory text means something different prior text meant repeal reading briefs footnote cited set haec verba thank mister mr blankingship mister mr ayer seven minutes remaining well nt difficulty point raised mister mr ayer take position recent amendment got say word subparagraph refers section one sentence regardless legislative drafting manuals think anybody would say well clause call clause subparagraph stretch least absence clear provision somewhere statute says use word subparagraph include clause basic implausibility guess find using subparagraph point statute refer mere clause well completely leaves even view leaves open question whether refers clause set three clauses nt answer question us whether subparagraph means clause well look either way seems one way see conflict question another way see think term used carveout words cap damages provided got mortgage cap going higher read either way argument reading question nt see argument excludes proviso kind reading right let mean start analysis something odd saying violation involving mortgage transaction get dollar two thousand violation conventional bank financing finance company financing dealer financing chattel transaction sky limit something strange houses cost cars odd would limitation potentially larger damages limitation let say recovery generic term limitation damages normally smaller transaction explain oddity well happen right moment business climate characteristic climate act operated years presumably operate interest rates start way back well cap still going get money would exactly kind behavior taken place respect financing mortgage half million dollar house strange well getting money back presumably going make whole far transaction concerned assume allowing transaction one going keep whole far transaction concerned issue get addition remaining whole steady respect value transaction ask question potential recovery one significantly greater potential recovery three iii even though one tends smaller transaction three iii bigger one question case client got problems act really address question got statute normally address still find something anomalous normal operation describe missing answer still left situation understand recovery small loan going potentially suppose many cases practically bigger recovery large loan still seems cuckoo let let ask question free decline answer rests upon assumption nt make fourth circuit make say look nt want defend fourth circuit okay fourth refuse answer exercise option answer laughter fourth circuit made assumption prior addition three iii dollar one hundred thousand minimum cap applied little one little one little two ii argued really nt sound assumption start fourth circuit making assumption reenactment one two ii three iii added fourth circuit position got think encounter general presumption repeals implication fourth circuit theory threshold cap applied roman little one without reenactment anything suddenly longer express provision effect nothing legislative history indicate intended seems difficult repeal implication problem answer problem express repeal win laughter words right guess go get mortgage get mortgage say half million dollars finance charge thirty years probably dollar six hundred thousand technical mistake made congress would wanted collect dollar one million two hundred thousand damages saying one cap older statute maximum amount financed house dollar one million saying got mortgage added paragraph three iii work get mortgage house finance charge thirty years huge amount money guess reading could collected millions nobody thought possible nt apply mortgages okay answer fine got answer mortgage three iii brings mortgages closedend mortgages fall three iii second openended mortgage home equity mortgage right home home equity mortgages fall one says closed says nonopenended says open end open end credit plan open credit plan correct okay replicate example right finance charges things hundreds thousands dollars saying guess could right asking one talking range dollar twentyfive thousand dollar fifty thousand doubled okay trying figure range reading one telescoping questions come away impression talking finance charges reading correct range dollar twentyfive thousand would mean damages would dollar fifty thousand double okay thank answered question right maybe help difficulty like speaking anyone else read statute first read usually call approach englishspeaking martian person nt know context read language reading language would think maybe better argument language support position sense possible reading maybe natural englishspeaking martian nonetheless possible reading bring claims first really nt make sense cap everything one second nt obviously anybody thought case third nothing legislative history fourth mean know fifth sixth seventh time finished ready abandon englishspeaking martian point view ask human purpose underlying statute language support like hear answer thinking mean limit three iii thought said dollar two hundred dollar two thousand yes asking purpose would mortgages know pretty big deal mortgage know really putting lot risk get mortgage limit dollar two thousand indeed dollar two thousand whatever ca nt get two ii limit talking would anybody want one limitless question saying answer want hear answer course two ii covered theory small two ii two ii also limited dollar twentyfive thousand gather well say congress wanted impose limit small two ii dollar twentyfive thousand less transactions nt want impose limit small one dollar twentyfive thousand transactions right little three iii three iii take three iii makes sense says whole subparagraph damages limited dollar one thousand special real estate thing limited dollar two thousand little three iii nt would clear little three iii say well maybe sometimes say little three iii superfluous word relevant congress added three iii nt reenact one little one one two ii congress basically left one one two ii alone congress add three iii nt reenact whole section well wait minute true nineteen ninetyfive understand understanding correct say two cases understanding hundreds lawyers practiced statute statute generally accepted cap subparagraph clause two ii apply cases clause one everyone accepted saying accept starting point nt think issue would serious question nt think would single case would arisen nineteen seventyfour nineteen ninetyfive made gave interpretation want call clause one clause two ii seems improbable could nt involved dollar one thousand people read statute way read correct read way read seems would lot cases making point would assume word subparagraph statute written merely referred clause two ii applied clause two ii cap one right think position would even plausible three iii added word subparagraph meant clause two ii yes true look footnote correct though looking footnote statute repeatedly use capital letter describe clearly subparagraph words saying read though said subparagraph two nt get actual damages case nt get actual damages case let let make sure understand seem taken two different positions think subparagraph one mean clause one clause two ii mean thing something different nineteen ninetyfive nineteen ninetyfive enactment added clause three iii change preexisting meaning one two ii agreeing prior nineteen ninetyfive amendment opponent reading one two ii would correct
