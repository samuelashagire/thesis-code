jury therefore ca nt take account mean issue case nt agreed sides jury take account fact sitting court entire argument jury entitled instruction regard right fifth amendment right nonincrimination jury entitled instruction take take defendant refusal testify admission guilt mister mr nuechterlein applied doyle would instruct jury take account fact heard testimony would nt question whether whether prosecutor invite jury attention fact jury would entitled understand doyle following doyle jury defendant would entitled instruction shall take account fact heard testimony prosecutor would nt much incentive case proposed justice kennedy mean argument going go jury say look guy sitting time able tailor testimony yet testimony entirely consistent witnesses say pretty much like think already said like trial judge charge may take consideration interest every witness outcome proceedings would apply defendant well witness witnesses defendant fact sequestered case sequestered yes well reason constitutional doctrine follow niceties law evidence impeach witnesses well mister mr zwerling mister mr nuechterlein pronounce name nuechterlein nuechterlein nuechterlein okay well well get area instructions trial court also get question whether defendant would request particular instruction know practiced long ago defense attorney criminal defense attorneys split question whether advantage defendant judge charge required take stand nt hold certainly constitutional law also called jury attention fact defendant nt taken stand maybe made worse nt think think terms automatic charges judge often requested could defendant nt request would nt given hand doyle facts inconsistency practical matter silence time questioning contrived story time trial inconsistency opportunity seems case fortiori doyle nt agree doyle may know thank mister mr nuechterlein ms ms van ness hear thank mister mr zwerling case submitted well respect exposure others like go back doyle minute one strands reasoning doyle defendant post miranda silence think ambiguous forget adjective insolubly ambiguous think phrase court used nt insoluble ambiguity problem predicate comment issue extent testimony defendant fact congruent witnesses save know crucial exculpatory point nt know presume absence affirmative evidence going truth falsity particular statements way jury know whether fact congruence result truth result tailoring comment like let alone instruction point given absence affirmative reason evidence think particular tailoring particular point sounds though ambiguity doyle would simply give jury kind wild card answer well true whether dealing something goes impeachment whether dealing something goes guilt problem ambiguity ambiguity bothering mr mister mr nuechterlein mentioned distinguishing doyle risk jury confusing impeachment proof guilt nt risk equally great jury going go mere presence suspicion tailoring tailoring lying old saw man lie steal whatever mean nt risk jury sort follow sequence reasoning well maybe would also eviscerate line doyle case estoppel point well nt understand maybe got assumption wrong conceding cause part prosecutor mention mean counted six seven times defense attorney emphasized word consistency three times said maybe two three defense attorney says defendant told totally consistent story nt use word totally says consistent story three four times said prosecuting witness story inconsistent prosecutor gets says sure consistent heard witnesses mean supposed decide case assumption cause prosecutor say well heard witnesses consistent heard defense attorney say inconsistent well know supposed decide case nt understand mean supposed look specifics case decide legal question right nt arguing could prosecutor make remark without correction district trial judge defendant testimony stand respects consistent testimony previous statements given police et cetera yes said ladies gentlemen know man testimony pretty well rehearsed would proper trial judge say ladies gentlemen jury want know testimony given consistent previous testimony could trial judge interrupt effect factual predicate concern adopt position without strong reasons recommend although comment usually made year hence standard every prosecutor manual trial judge say ladies gentlemen jury would extraordinary occurrence defendant present phases trial must present order assist counsel apprised charges therefore hold go back forth well suppose trial judge could go say find altered testimony reason presence take account whole point seems new area going comment countercomment instructions may interrupt sure answered justice oconnor question said could get different question could would prosecutor entitled instruction suggested may draw adverse inference fact rule evidence prosecutorial misconduct comments argument evidentiary question presented sure well prosecutor make comment even though nothing record would imply inconsistency testimony actual fact whereas doyle fact silent somewhat inconsistent come story later may ask one verify brief question refer state cases arisen correct thinking cases came view improper comment nt see
