well let ask think possible instances valid strategy focus punishment sentencing phase rather guilt phase lawyer reviewed evidence appears lawyer overwhelming possible case strategy might make sense possible possible well building something nt ask asking possible better strategy defendant given case would focus sentencing rather guilt phase based evaluation attorney evidence well think correct equivalent guilty plea cross examination participation nt accept statement functional equivalent standard employ tacit consent failure affirmatively respond well said could affirm applied cronic thought issue whether perhaps strickland applied strickland applies would nt think affirming necessarily well question standard applies thought court correct florida supreme court employ cronic standard reviewed strickland us one questions okay thank mister mr tillinghast may go back something said nt want lose sight seem suggest defendant absence trial work favor defendant choice judge met said want make sure know right count defendant favor absented trial would give fugitive credit entirely opening closing lawyer said jury want know opening case life death ultimate decision make said opening said closing nt simply case saying client prosecutor going go motions told jury want focus decision going make whether counsel words spare life well say without consent least record suggests client told lawyer planned said nothing justice scalia asked question prior argument ongoing client nt say yes nt say take words familiar song must nt lawyer thinks best says okay going going require fullstop trial going cross examine every witness may damaging client client nt tell told must nt lawyer situation exercise best judgment object spare person life knows evidence strong wants extent insulate penalty phase damning evidence coming trial wants evidence come trial nt want situation jury heard defendant resist determination plead life well problem sure understand answer case fact client nt say yes nt say lawyer assume well since nt positive explicit yes assume answer even though lawyer best interest lawyer best judgment effective counsel assumes answer may ask question asked side nt accept argument think client silent lawyer must exercise best judgment assume client would give answer would jeopardize client position position court adopts would say left remand simply florida supreme court takes record determines strickland whether effective ineffective performance would would brief information things lawyer done way cross examination nt put record denied trial court introduction lawyer might done nt agree earlier statement defendant expected contested trial know state evidence challenged blah blah blah contrary said whole thing big railroad job one reason nt want go ahead whatever want nt nt expecting fact talking subjective expectations would reinforce lawyer belief objection conceding guilt referring one big railroad job thought made statements railroaded found lawyer concession think correct difference capital case regular case insofar intelligence strategy concerned even separate penalty phase sometimes interest defendant effect throw mercy sentencer whether jury judge contesting fact acts charged occurs capital case regular cases well problem according lower courts good strategy nt know want counsel client nt answer say gee know nt know whether approved disapproved going take course probably get executed nt received answer would force course lawyer lawyer believes silence implies consent silence usually let lawyer client best interest nixon okay inquiry nixon stands nt say thing assuming could get courtroom know assuming put clothes could bring courtroom sits say well since nt answer take course going get guy executed nt seem make much sense nt hearing issues way nt talking way florida supreme court assume raised issue inadequate performance counsel opportunity introduce whatever evidence subject way florida supreme court nt know florida supreme court obliged remand order give second bite apple thought boykin boykin brookhart really somewhat different matter language functional equivalent guilty plea lifted brookhart boykin brookhart judge lawyer boykin judge accepted guilty plea court said ca nt without express consent defendant brookhart judge accepted odd procedure procedure court called functional equivalent guilty plea therefore talking judge talking lawyer arises level improper lack counsel nt think govern rather thought want view relevant case really roe v nt file appeal little odd thing said consult government saying exposing thought process get reaction guilty plea words guilty plea something accepted judge judge nt grant odd situation special wonder appropriate way kind requirement ought maybe something sure rise level consultation since know better awfully difficult clients virtually incapable understanding interests awfully reluctant go beyond saying consult client start insisting answer nt know going say mister mr tillinghast ask familiar loeb leopold trial many many years ago conducted clarence darrow wo nt push applied exactly strategy one great victories fact long long time ago way clarence darrow sized problem think case young clients nt expressly consent saved lives thank mister mr tillinghast mister mr lemieux four minutes left well equate case defendant accidentally present got problem opening two sentences justice ginsburg said defendant absent courtroom well case absent chose absent equating case one reason forgot courtroom nt know thought literature replete law review articles saying best strategy trial judges told us best strategy nt quite understand hesitation unless build factor consent thought something say well course well basic question matter trial strategy recognized acceptable sometimes prudent sometimes wise strategy concentrate sentencing phase let ask question assuming make statement prefaced argument effect complete breakdown adversary process assuming take say guilt phase penalty phase got regarded distinct separate phases dividing half legitimate lawyer mean presume defense lawyer tailors guilt phase representation without thought going happen penalty phase get penalty phase difficulty saying kind firewall analytical purposes guilt penalty question cronic strickland well would nt end lower standards would end standard guilt phase takes consideration lawyer going able plausibly sentencing phase know may difficult questions hard say either standard different lawyer setting standards pretend lawyer somehow go state oblivion going happen sentencing gets nt think getting bothers us nobody saying client make decision problem client wo nt make decision client acts made decision allow lawyer lawyer proposes nt question whether heard make behavior saying behavior appears acquiescence silence nonetheless lawyer nonetheless obligated take course coming closest guaranteeing receive death penalty bothering us need hearing rather examination record tell talking trial well denied opportunity judge say look going confine strictly one issue okay
