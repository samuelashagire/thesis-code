different district court find common questions predominate without addressing question whether damages proven classwide basis always interlinked one one questions case question mister mr estrada reference jury trial judge nt really gate call gatekeeper function jury judge admits evidence turns nt meet standard reliability exclude nt nt see judge say right first going daubert next going whether reliable magic words approach seems well take argument whether expert qualified question whether theory makes sense petitioner says nt well think initial reaction awful long time since courtroom whether man qualified give opinion one next thing opinion make sense court trieroffact chooses reserved cases jury seems indicated whole question weight admissibility somewhat less important trial judge gatekeeper trial judge end day hear testimony say know admitted testimony nt make sense nt work well said one hundred pages findings think disagree judge make determination view class certified includes factual inquiries damages alleged cause injury whether common whether commonality well think understanding thought judge make determination next case going hear morning representation material affects market judge make conclusion make finding well course matters trier fact determine merits stage daubert rule seven oh two judge say evidence relevant task hand reliable foundation see judge saying well theory using theory works think accepted academia hears testimony says nt work sure described daubert thank counsel mister mr barnett elaborate discussion briefs whether claim waived court addressed yet court review first view seems one option court since reformulate question answer question send back court determine whether parties adequately preserved option objection well fine mean district court presumably decide based proceedings scars messups whether adequately preserved counsel seems answer justice sotomayor whether likely something used trial one
