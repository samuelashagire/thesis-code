mister mr deano let ask question two socalled class one really class one five people involved suit yes well nt fact class one court ever said equal protection clause addresses classes opposed individuals ever said mean city wants single one citizen irrational action nt citizen protected nt even understand vindictiveness point mean city says ms ms olech wo nt hook city water unless give us fifty feet land street every person city say fine hook give us five feet say fifty feet vindictiveness mean equal protection claim ms ms olech nt claim treated differently required fifty feet ten feet every person city nt matter reason nt treat citizens equally hooking city water also seems pointed dismissed face complaint mean normally would nt make motion file answer would motions summary judgment look nt know village willowbrook took unusual route thought right dismiss complaint rather file answer well complaint boils treated differently every citizen comes hooking water enough nt matter one person five person five people go file answer know answered question go file answer mean nt enough get beyond dismissal complaint reach le sage hardly dismissal mister mr deano one problem answer get even know purpose government case tossed twelve b complaint said nt complaint part plaintiff sets state village reason yes thank nt read complaint say wanted thirtythree feet widen road everybody else wanted fifteen feet fine want thirtythree exercise power eminent domain pay us difference thirtythree fifteen complaint saying supposed read liberally twelve b would nt reason still inadequate everybody else either asked thirtythree paid difference carry far saying yeah conceived shown record indeed basis tempest teapot essentially saying yeah class one court always dream rational basis government end case mister mr deano said theory plaintiff complaint nt make retaliation filing litigation basis lawsuit complaint conjure every conceivable basis negate pleading supposed look like keep referring impermissible constitution says shall deny people equal protection laws constitutionally impermissible period well course rational basis difference becomes constitutionally impermissible rational basis oh perfectly rational basis want additional forty feet greedy perfectly rational see certainly intentional difference treatment intentionally trying get fifty feet one person ten feet another nt enough say enough intent right right enough according suppose hatred baseless okay mean really woman deserves hated something would make right rational basis taking thirtythree feet rational basis treating person different people right people need thirtythree feet people always talking rational basis though means actual rational basis always thought rational basis test means conceivable rational basis nt look whether state actually rational basis mind might basis invent imagination since could supported rational would assert conceivable rational basis overcome claim violation equal protection even bring evidence show oh yeah might rational basis fact get use rational basis get would say still equal beginning talk subjectively conceivable legitimate well well supposing let fifty foot ten foot examples mrs mrs olech want fifty feet people identically situated want ten feet simply result goof city clerk office one mrs mrs olech nonetheless way comes fact mistake rather conscious thing make equal protection claim disappear nt know motion complaint motion dismiss say facts necessary support argument rational basis deduced complaint know nt necessarily follow case seventh circuit perhaps would nt hear enough complaint support traditional equal protection claim would nt get one nt need find vindictiveness order say complaint like states claimed relief equal protection clause seems would nt get esmail question thank mister mr deano mister mr gornstein hear well decide going treat person differently filed lawsuit village turns perfectly rational basis treating differently doyle approach hypothetical would court say yes prima facie denial equal protection fifty feet versus ten feet respondent come perfectly good explanation also find motive rational basis simply wanted get person filed lawsuit kind dug rational basis later happens doyle would done anyway would propose conceive one thank mister mr gornstein mister mr wimmer hear would agree may claim stated individual otherwise member class individual states differential treatment rationally related legitimate governmental purpose agree formulation say alleges rational basis establishing roads governmental objective answer well rational basis differential treatment words theory government treat people otherwise unjustifiably differential way long isolation legitimate objective treating individual way individual treated words government says well think take ten feet property owner twentyfive feet property owner next door fifty feet property owner next door instance going take land want establish streets take argument long instance want establish streets fact intentionally differentiating amount land taken irrelevant argument okay words rational basis difference treatment okay think asking rather lot court like mean thought took case find whether one person otherwise member class state equal protection claim think perhaps point everybody agreeing answer yes argument whether response claim found record legitimate governmental purpose demand rationally related sure really business nt complaint alleging may right alleges difference says us wanted sixtysix feet build road everybody else town wanted fifteen feet nt enough build road basis distinction took saying right say face complaint nt state claim may right wrong nt know took case take decide whether one person could state equal protection claim first thing read nt one person five get much difficult question motive forth well suppose singled government motive also happens rational basis take judge posner said said said stated claim reason anybody could give far complaint concerned distinction hatred malice absurd state mind get exact words want says refuses perform obligation one residents reason reason reason baseless hatred would violate equal protection clause well record complaint nt see rational basis complaint well every case defamation libel intentional torts committed state officer breach contract let assume state wrong cases illegal activities nt know rational basis would every one actions become equal protection clause action well every case could cases government committed intentional tort intentionally breached contract think argument consistent either justice stone opinion snowden learned hand opinion burt seems suggest missing allegation precisely allegation got yes understand seems one confined snowden burt would lose later cases rely understand seems two cases definitely read snowden way learned hand read lose usually pretty good judge say yes allegation motive like also construed saying rational basis explain except motive really functional equivalent allegation rational basis tends consistent notion city later came round later said fifteen feet enough still nondedicated said fifteen feet enough yes vindictiveness allegedly retaliation filing lawsuit assume statutory right least file well filing vindictiveness one hand caused hostility race another case caused hostility fact lawsuit filed would say different cases well nt second well allege vindictiveness caused fact filed earlier lawsuit class litigants city rule anybody sues city get disparate treatment thirtythree feet instead fifteen feet policy would equal protection challenge nt case oh agree respondent let interrupt one question fact nonpublic road involved explain disparate treatment fifteen feet thirtythree feet possibly explain rational basis face nt rational policy surely disclosed complaint ever said court ever said abstract freefloating duty government always act rationally nt said duty act rationally applies government actions affect certain person reason government get person race cause action suspect class constitutional right involved suppose discriminating allegedly exercise constitutional right begin opinion case saying constitutional right similarly situated persons treated equally law opening line necessary reduce number suits filed federal court reduce intervention courts routine governmental actions compromising basic principle saying county council board commissioners said going bury application nt like guy tell constitutionally permissible result otherwise race basis history core principle equal protection clause mister mr deano supposing case asked fifty feet mrs mrs olech property asked ten feet people whose property indistinguishable mrs mrs olech say would sort equal protection claim laughter laughter
