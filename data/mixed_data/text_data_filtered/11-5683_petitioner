well might assume drafting legislation want apply defendants commit offense enactment fair sentencing act also want everything reasonably make sure first one defendants comes sentencing new sentencing guidelines effect geared new lower mandatory minimums rather old sentencing guidelines effect would provide would require sentencing commission act quickly possible get new sentencing guidelines would say take time nt matter defendants commit offense enactment fair sentencing act come subjected old soontobeobsolete sentencing guidelines could ask argument think one stressing good argument best one troubles earlier bill hr hr two sixtyfive contained provision says shall retroactive application portion act contains language stressing reconcile understand would nt want problem maybe understand argument language stressing mean applies postenactment offenders defendants sentenced old old mandatory minimums new guidelines would occur clearly occur hr hr two sixtyfive well along lines could could ask question intended explore issue whether argument bringing guidelines consistency applicable law nt assume answer one attempts get suppose fair sentencing act said expressly applies new mandatory minimums apply postact offenders also contained provision says sentencing commission bring guidelines consistency applicable law assume would would say new guidelines apply postenactment offenders fair sentencing act would trump previous provision sentencing reform act would nt correct think clear unmistakable implication going argue language well generally word express incorporates clear nt defeat case mister mr dreeben almost law repeals prior penalty legislature determines prior penalty unjust way eliminate penalty unless think necessary injust unjust way makes repeal particularly different exception nt swallow rule argue almost situation repeal something unjust mister mr estrada difficult legal doctrine say congress made finding law discriminatory impact always thought discrimination issue speedy remedy could one fundamental tenets constitution repeatedly emphasized case case laws enforced raceneutral way congress said law enforced raceneutral way want fix nt presumption fix immediate rather delayed mister mr estrada judge nearly twenty years nt know one law created controversy discussion racial impact one nt think law much conversation racial implications one well mister mr estrada even without guideline amendment defendants committed crimes effective date act would new offense old offense day act committed offense would nt mandatory minimum required imprisonment certain amount time act already done away mandatory minimum correct changed guide changed lowered amounts exactly people would bound mandatory minimum since district courts bound guidelines anyway even amendment guideline judges would known nt bound mandatory minimum probably bound guidelines nt amended yet either would benefited defendants matter cases like know change congress directed changed problem started know new congress already determined mandatory minimum discriminatory way constructed would purpose delaying implementation mister mr estrada mister mr estrada sure follow sorry sure follow example think guideline regulation guideline sentencing commission always pass guidelines consistent mandatory minimum statute says mandatory minimum requires carrying medium included guidelines ca nt change mandatory minimum would apply defendant nt know know one guideline scheme changes whatever congress statutorily required arguing guidelines would available new offenses arguing would available everybody except cliffhangers arguing everyone cliffhangers justice breyer pointed people subject old guideline higher rate minimum benefit lower rate going get sentenced lower amount bound mandatory minimum right right true cases cases pointed two three use fair implication court cases found fair implication one oh nine governed nt nt true marrero true northern securities none cases used fair implication language court say therefore old statute longer governs relying standard court must considered appropriate deviated words statute said times application always came way true one oh nine cases nt one oh nine case says standard fair implication therefore old statute enforced pick date fair sentencing act went effect guidelines ninety day period commission came new guidelines november first time august three sentencing act theory nt right date date sentencing guidelines went effect draw line someplace inevitable people going fall one side point guidelines statute working together nt time sentencing guidelines wanted away distinction congress said sentencing commission ca nt ca nt guidelines nt statute congress say sentencing commission conform new guidelines applicable law applicable law got new law old law nothing conform nothing need change section otherwise commission nt anything achieve consistency excuse fair implication enough talking repealer essentially earlier provision section one oh nine cases uniformly say clear implication unquestionable implication think really clear unquestionable really troubled fair implication many many cases say fair implication opposed quite say clear unquestionable implication marrero one case rely footnote marrero right yes anything else marcello cite mean lot earlier cases make clear repealing prior statute nt express least clear implication astounded think footnote suddenly going change simply fair implication well different question talk marrero come find overruling find one oh nine overcome fair implication right entirely dictum right dictum footnote thought way holding one oh nine governed thought said holding section one oh nine governed repealed exactly therefore whatever said necessary repeal one oh nine purely dictum held one oh nine repealed even fair implication test test applied determinative case dictum dictum footnote right oh sure arguing think acknowledges opinions say done implication clear unmistakable implication think position taking anyway want tell clear unmistakable exactly think would come way think entirely right accelerated direction guidelines commission promulgate guidelines emergency basis put nothing justice alito suggesting effect comparable said fine apply applicable law say admittedly people prosecuted convicted sentenced applicable law may many deprive language meaning well begging question law applicable pre prestatute offenses continues prior law applicable law offenses occurred enactment date new guidelines people issue new begging question people committed offenses act one set applicable guidelines people leave effect people committed offense enactment date prior guidelines nt think anything necessarily implied provision effect future one set guidelines applied know one guideline fits nt think excuse thirty thirtynine section thirtyseven fortytwo g okay mean yes nice let talk text emotions congress section quoted section thirtyfive fiftythree new statute effect amendment congress nt insert made amendment saying incidental effect provision congress adopt would find extraordinary say racist going leave effect sentences previously imposed seems unlikely mister mr estrada would like explain effect three fiftythree course could say statute runs afoul section one oh nine mean section one oh nine says even though decided old law bad penalty lesser even though decided continue apply bad old penalty people committed crime amendment nt one oh nine says think think stick language statute indeed looking express provision agree nt mister mr estrada mean true took congress long time decide question decided decide whether would make sense decided guidelines new guidelines mandatory minimums old mandatory minimums everybody understood case new guidelines old mandatory minimums sort applied together would lead ridiculous disparities way people sentenced question decided ca nt assume congress decided begs question mister mr estrada understand argument relates justice scalia questions want make sure understand person four point nine nine grams crack cocaine dispute person would subject new guidelines based eighteen one ratio rather one hundred one ratio okay dispute living world person four point nine nine grams cocaine getting eighteen one ratio person five grams getting one hundred one ratio embedded mandatory minimums judge easterbrook talked anomaly course adopted position adopted said look earthly reason ca nt find clear enough statement statute guess question would ask better judge easterbrook find earthly reason congress would wanted create weird halfway system four one half grams cocaine one rule applies five grams another rule applies could understand saying mister mr estrada justice alito right new guidelines sentencing commission fact promulgated applied right committed crimes enactment date happening ground yes many talking say three month period many people commit people everybody pleads guilty caught quickly know necessarily want estimate many talking long historically roughly know take time person caught till time sentenced pleads guilty eleven months many see trying get trying get guess like many people talking two numbers ca nt find briefs roughly opponent correct applies new people thing applicable law words assuming answer answer justice scalia assuming answer nt heard argument except people interpretation opposite interpretation would catch many mean like ten like fifty like one hundred make guess right nt obviously trying get see trying get guess saying would absurd think section eight prior preenactment offenses absurd right likely one person tend buy absurdity argument likely five hundred one thousand much less certain yes argument course could mind could applicable law new people new statute applicable old people nt need amendment talking apply old law makes perfect sense suppose wrong mean think meant consider change mean think wrote thirtyfive fiftythree thinking guidelines going apply look reach conclusion reach competing background briefs applicable law nt help us time two different sets guidelines apply depending upon committed crime common right agree far worried last question justice scalia asked think focus question one oh nine also one talking says normally apply guidelines effect even people committed crime new statute analogies ever happened ca nt find many people talking like know least many occasions congress amended mandatory minimums precedence yes yes wait wait tell maybe light dawning maybe question justice kagan asked think statute two sets people people subject mandatory minimum crack people mandatory minimum nt matter commission wrote amendments consistent tough amendments law nt require produce consistency statute passed preact offenders two sets things section eight one hand thirtyfive fiftythree g combination two sections mister mr dreeben read right get cliffs justice kagan talking right far back probation officer example odd peculiar fair see going complicated laughter nt blame frankly right nt blame nt blame imagine would find disagreement know know know matter fact year took effect think sentences governed mandatory crack governed mandatory minimum guidelines provide let call low sentence disproportionately low change nonmandatory part wrote new ones look look well statement one congress bind later congress mean supposed look one oh nine supposed look dictionary act fact one oh nine books relevant question one congress binding question second congress well ignore dictionary ignore one oh nine well nt nt bring us right back one oh nine says government arguing petitioner arguing uniform rule rule time sentencing controls uniformity nt quite answer unless misunderstood justice kagan question concerning interest served position particular force talking sentencing judge hardest thing know judicial system one hardest things sentencing saying sentencing judge knows law changed knows law criticized nevertheless bound determined fair person sentenced longer term difficult position put judge would go ahead course statute says express right talking section one oh nine pretty far removed language statute guess oh understand presumably also proposition congress enacts legislation knows law would known section one oh nine required express statement wanted apply change retroactively nt hold standard justice scalia supposed assume congress knows mean asked long usual time conviction mean arrest conviction would nt know closer ninety days eleven months well right mean assume congress knows law nt know readily assume know details evaluate would position congress said soon practical event later eight months would think fair implication congress meant apply retroactively thank counsel mister mr dreeben ninety days mean commission basically took ratio new act applied nt throughout took mandatory minimum formula changed changed throughout sentencing provisions certainly thank counsel mister mr estrada go ahead justice sotomayor thank mister mr estrada mister mr eberhardt three minutes arguments nothing provision sentencing commission supposed act quickly right argument rational reason could congress given urgency problem seriousness would nt wanted provisions apply urged thank mister mr eberhardt mister mr estrada invitation court briefed argued case amicus curiae support judgment ably discharged responsibility court grateful case submitted
