nt mister mr haynes point suggested end argument questions accrual involve much complicated factual questions usually involved deciding whether court jurisdiction imagine case came today government adhered prior position nt know whether still position permanent taking nineteen ninetyeight would court none events happened nineteen ninetyeight brought court attention would court say parties well fine see fence put nineteen ninetyeight tell us everything else happened site going back ten years see whether whether claim might accrued earlier point nt think good argument would obligation say think permanent fence put nineteen ninetyeight agree taking point nt think happened earlier need know additional facts would obligation present court certainly would mixing categories terribly suggested something goes court authority proceed case waived equitable waive mean two notions odds well would would irwin franconia made statements question time limit operate government like operate private parties kind case would apply mean pointed twentyfive oh one covers whole slew cases takings cases rules court federal claims rule eight c suits government court federal claims deals would

would say well nt jurisdictional right nt nt think quite putting argument understand would say let look irwin read mind think set statute limitations federal ones government ones either ambiguous irwin even ambiguous think set irwin court says absence special circumstances whole set going interpreted nonjurisdictional says say well irwin nt talk suppose member set previously court held jurisdictional nt tell us shall read exception shall saying nt read exception need congress probably never really thought stuff read irwin including one think point whether leaving aside argument whether particular statute fall within set assume absolutely right question simple fact previously held contrary count rebuttal irwin mean see question think nt statutes limitations generally equivocal may go back answer gave justice stevens asked assume precedent reading original matter thought answer correct wrong well event shall barred means ca nt waived anyway statute looked statutes

decisions beginning eighteen eightythree court repeatedly construed six year filing requirement contained section twentyfive oh one predecessors nonwaivable jurisdictional limit court claim authority

equitable tolling court irwin recognized presumption could rebutted kendall soriano court relied inter alia fact statute listed specific instances six year period could tolled evidence general

oh one predecessors respect statutory time limits suing government generally terms congress consent suit define jurisdiction reviewing court time limit commencing suit one terms would direct court attention particular united states v decided less nine months irwin decided opinion dalm suffused references jurisdictional character time limit commencing suit government obviously government side irwin sense best person defend court reasoning reading irwin would create anomaly could potentially jurisdictional limit nevertheless subject equitable tolling argument side irwin sub silentio swept away numerous decisions court recited terms government consent suit jurisdictional limits time limit one terms well certainly kind case court specifically dealing irwin uncommon type case one congress passed statute imposes obligations private parties imposes like obligations government gestalt title seven amended add federal government potential defendant impose substantive obligations government government dealt respect matters employment discrimination way private employer would like circumstances well franconia court dealing different question words first accrues mean held essentially treated phrase first accrues term art one appeared prior statutes governing suits defendants saw reason believe congress intended words mean anything different section twentyfive oh one meant statutes limitations guess point would make franconia irwin even read irwin broadest even construe mean presumption time limits suing government nonjurisdictional well subject tolling court irwin still made clear presumption could rebutted presumption limit congress authority simply aid construction situations tools interpretation nt produce clear result would say would nt read text statute would read permit waiver explain statute reproduced pertinent part page two government brief statute provides every claim united states every claim united states court federal claims jurisdiction shall barred unless petition thereon filed within six years claim first accrues looking text statute language categorical says every claim filed six years accrual shall barred statute terms makes exception cases government fails raise think often statutes limitations written like point end petitioner argument really plain language argument petitioner argument understand looking language statute would say might say jurisdictional bar presumes jurisdiction respect substantive question presented namely whether united states failure make argument timely way causes waived statute nt support petitioner position categorical nt terms carve exception cases united states fails raise rule eight c think could certainly obviously could nt supersede decisions court even federal circuit think rule basically tracks although precisely tracks language parallel federal rule civil procedure would read simply mean extent affirmative defense pleaded initially nt say defense waived pleaded return point making earlier end petitioner argument plain language argument petitioner argument notwithstanding absence face statute exception cases united states fails plead timeliness defense court read section twentyfive oh one backdrop large body law holding statutes limitations generally waivable assume congress intended incorporate understanding well think think essentially relates point making even presumption nonjurisdictionality announced irwin rebuttable presumption simply aid construction view yes little artificial talk language congress might used light irwin make clear intent treated jurisdictional congress nineteen fortyeight judicial code chose recodify essentially language previously construed impose jurisdictional limit point making petitioner argument imputed congressional intent end petitioner position depends inference body law saying statutes limitations ordinarily waivable congress assumed intended incorporate body law point trying impute congress intent makes much sense assume congress intended recodify reading court attached particular provision congress intended incorporate meaning court attached statutes limitations court specifically distinguished one worth emphasizing decisions kendall finn de arnaud ca nt accused sort loose less meticulous use jurisdictional language court recently said unexceptional said many statutes limitations used language namely phrase first accrues one points court franconia attached significance fact court claims never given phrase broader reading section twentyfive oh one court cited additional evidence phase understood particular statute bear meaning would statutes limitations think principal line authority federal circuit says jurisdictional ca nt disputed court said jurisdictional court used term passing well think would given fact particular court irwin nt speak explicitly question jurisdictionality one way think uncommon dissenting opinion make assertions reach majority opinion majority opinion sometimes sometimes respond well think court irwin trying adopt clear rule across board trying adopt presumption recognizing congress could provide individual statutes rule different one presumption would suggest congress already told language using would treated jurisdictional court kendall line cases simply used label jurisdictional said statutes limitations governing suits private parties waived asserted timely fashion time limit filing suit united states court claims different limit court authority court required notice whether pleaded government think congress told already using language would effect causing jurisdictional nonwaivable mean think think may well correct perhaps extent drafters rule something simply incorporating existing language comparable federal rule civil procedure saying statute limitations would function affirmative defense cases court want pleaded immediately would private civil action saying may well right class cases would pertain null set something close well guess two three responses first least judgment could entered favor plaintiff court would ultimately determine taking would determine date taking occurred order award compensation nothing else seems like kind question would ultimately determined least plaintiff could successful second thing pointed least majority cases viable limitations argument government going plead asking court look beyond would depend upon court rules court required separate statement jurisdiction probably advocate would include least thumbnail sketch relevant facts rules court advocate nt address jurisdiction unless actively contesting guess fundamental point would make speculation disruptive results would carry lot force government asking rule different done past even petitioner would concede great bulk country history rule treated jurisdictional petitioner argument simply line authority effectively overruled irwin nineteen ninety fact treating limit jurisdictional limit would effect disrupting litigation cfc cfc would expect petitioner actual evidence effect asking different rule enforced past would think true even cases involving barriers everyone would concede jurisdictional instance cases litigant sues us great doubt standing sue may issue think otherwise framed appropriate context government might feel would everyone benefit get issue resolved one way one consequence treating jurisdictional barrier simply government ca nt always way nt think would think correct might instances treatment limit jurisdictional bar would government interest basis holding nonjurisdictional certainly majority cases involving think involving twentyfive oh one provisions impose time limits suits government courts held relevant limit jurisdictional typically situation arises government decides make argument appeal nt make district court think case like one government nt argue point even appeal court appeals nevertheless holds suit untimely rarity certainly agree logical implication treating time limit jurisdictional federal circuit right thing like say couple words bowles think bowles nt compel ruling government favor support position various respects first chief justice alluded earlier bowles emphasized time limits filing notices appeal historically treated jurisdictional limits court said given choice calling question dicta recent opinions effectively overruling century worth practice think former option prudent course agree court opinions nt note fact nt think fact would affected treatment statute jurisdictional brought congress attention potential conflict tension language jurisdictional statute language corresponding federal rule congress choice make govern congress wanted different result one federal rule could enacted different language think would whatever might privately think level attention congress point brought congress attention congress could chosen stick language case doubt corresponding rule would amended fit statute whatever level attention might privately think congress devoted question fact congress acted body passed law signed passed statutes houses signed law president point forward statutory rule treated agree aspect problem nt

brought attention congress could enacted whatever statute wanted chose enact statute tracked preexisting language rule time forward notice appeal deadline grounded statute statutory limit applied bowles notice appeal nt think basis saying case would come differently court aware history statute development point reading statute without reference precedent addressing either twentyfive oh one statutes limitations generally kind pure myopic literal reading statute without reference legal context would suggest every means every shall barred means shall barred exception cases government fails raise argument timely way point point basis petitioner argument inferring congress intent court look part broader legal context namely decisions court others dealt general treatment statutes limitations ignore part legal context namely decisions court said squarely unequivocally particular time limit different particular time limit nonwaivable jurisdictional even though statutes limitations waived asserted timely way government could better represented honor laughter reaction reading transcript thank beyond seas something know nt found difficult enough figure statutes jurisdictional want us say well even jurisdictional consequences may different jurisdiction equitable tolling waivibility mean seems difficult argument suppose franconia would case irwin logic would apply hard understand could lost case laughter thank mister mr stewart mister mr haynes three minutes remaining mister mr stewart ask question think defense equitable tolling would available statute nt think irwin even changed equitable tolling rule justice rehnquist sentence think case affords us opportunity adopt general rule govern applicability equitable tolling suits government implied

left words united states court claims jurisdiction yes yes said case issue case whether franconia overruled mean soriano overruled justice white thought said many words interesting justice rehnquist majority nt disagree rather cited justice white dissent part description statutes different others comes points want adopt general rule applies statutes seems implicit opinion disagree justice white characterization interesting part discussion majority case part development fact got cases lot want adopt clear rule apply across board part reasoning court one last question disagreed parts irwin
