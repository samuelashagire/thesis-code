district judge decide reasonable costeffective considerations situation emission greenhouse gases totally prohibited countervailing interests court district court balance interests seriously argue nt nt orders magnitude complicated case anybody substantial contributor could sued even district court imposed sort limit would obstacle plaintiffs bringing suits another district court issuing different standard setting standards would difficult tradeoffs would nt could explain concrete terms district judge would deal let determining facts going hard enough let assume facts proven dispute facts certain reduction greenhouse gas emissions ordered effect increase cost electricity certain amount produce certain effects result loss certain number jobs mean consumers less money spend things people able air conditioning summer health effects district judge standard district judge decide reasonable general underwood relief seeking asking court set standards emissions sounds like kind thing epa epa mean congress set epa epa promulgate standards emissions relief seeking seems set district judge resources expertise kind super epa epa concentrate think relief want say district court pass everything else set emissions standards put cap immediately set cap annually require reductions well sounds like epa epa sets emission standards agency agency engaged right another facet case potential conflict epa epa acting agreed authority classify pollutant taken first steps one argument epa epa united states presenting way agencies go incrementally starting motor vehicles maybe go new sources get maybe want court start existing sources set limits may conflict existing agency ignore fact epa epa regulating area point epa epa unless epa epa gets point setting standards existing sources court side side agency know agency beginning starts light motor vehicles moving forward say long epa epa nt gotten stationary sources court conducting similar function one many differences epa epa setting standards set notice comment everybody able put submission court substituting epa epa court replicate notice comment process agency know operates certain way notice comment rulemaking court operate get standards one aspect litigation process opposed agency process agency makes rule challenged court suppose plaintiffs lost case merits take class action certification class plaintiffs another district court could launch similar action defendants right would nothing preclude means well nt think nt think mind state law preemption either indeed state law positively conflicts federal statute nt matter whether congress state law mind nt know nt told us certainly harder find preemption require congressional intent whereas whereas displacement nt difference difference lumping together suppose lump together cows country would would allow sue farmers mean nt defendant defendant cow cow least farm farm lump everybody together lump together people united states breathe suppose right homes homes emit carbon dioxide heating systems whole country lump together say know equals ten percent whatever give basis well nt give us ten percent figure give us know maximum figure single one implausible implausible word looking laughter wish justice breyer made argument epa epa case nt think epa epa case laughter epa epa comes different number would one achieve litigation would epa epa prevail would epa epa number prevail number prevail yes yes mean displace judgment obtained federal law right court says general usually facts determined administrative agency mean even reading part complaint sounds like paradigmatic thing administrative agencies rather courts would living different world administrative agency clean air act epa epa made judgment judgment liked suppose epa epa said looked stationary sources going regulate would displace general think federal common law cause action anybody world briefs talk lot five largest emissions producers saw nothing theory limit five something think limits large emissions producers rather anybody world general much argument depends notion suit really like pollution suit pollution suits talking much localized affairs one factory emitting discharge one stream nt involve kinds national international policy issues kind case mean huge gap chasm precedents case nt courts set tax well suppose costeffective suppose complaint alleged get reading might best way deal problem would like court impose tax twenty dollars ton carbon right bring polluters injury everything fourteen experts say get done costeffective lead substitution actually bring world without global warming let district judge opinion power enter order right next question going power enter order could proved extremely effective least possible harm consumer power enter order want oh addressed says abate nuisance going going put twenty dollars tax ton carbon lo behold discover nuisance abated bring fifteen economists well less intrusive try get details electricity company fact run operation say make change dollar sign charge product concede still displacement argument factors go costbenefit analysis would undertaken decide level emissions reasonable light threat global global warming obviously greatest benefit reduce global warming would course shut power plants right right mean across economy whole problem dealing global warming costs benefits sides determine much want readjust world economy address global warming think pretty big burden post impose district court judge dealing electric grid connects nt know vast area certainly vast area fact reduce emissions way nt affect customers based fact power plants part grid serve part serve customers needs extent suppose reasons congress adopted approach suit would override determinations much much regulation need would admit displacement preemption analysis adopting displacement analysis test displacement tell whether displacement displacement case total displacement sounds like sounds like preemption displacement least preemption another label well maybe tell extent displacement different preemption tell area going displacement preemption guess way around going preemption well difference said response justice kagan made considered decision amount amount higher lower would displacement way different preemption think right theory operate pretty similarly thought whole point milwaukee v well stop us us emissions percentage worldwide emissions every one assume harms clients five power plants represent infinitesimal right power plants total emissions agree general katyal began argument fairly dramatic fashion saying never two twentytwo years case relief damages relief sought broad anything rebut proposition case broad best candidate rebut proposition broader case respect infliction damage need relief well many contribute global warming well true every litigation sense everyone harmed global warming unless limit suits states would aware principled basis every individual bring every individual world establish jurisdiction bring one cause causes action well guess follow appellate court reviewing reviewing reasonableness epa epa judgment continuing validity injunction entered previously seems displacement normal process administrative law would review agency determination best extent regulate emissions yes guess central problem turn litigation entirely different set standards would regulate emissions opposed standards would apply respect agency determination thank general underwood mister mr keisler five minutes remaining
