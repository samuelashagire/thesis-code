mister mr clement may ask question relating affirmative defenses youthful adult pornography appears affirmative defense possession something fact used adults right well let relate something perhaps number people courtroom seen film traffic depicts guess someone purports eighteen engaged conduct would fit definition statute banned right see okay presumably would covered defense someone rents movie possess affirmative defense defense producer nt person rents film struck supposed statute like court relied heavily notion use actual children harmed actually harmed primary reliance make applying prohibition video images seem court played heavy reliance harm children actual children asking primary reliance nt even language says conveys impression want us give meaning terms outlined terms two dangers say actual child well young adult looks like child seems everything said virtual pornography would apply young adult looks like child obscenity creating would us create yet another category prohibitive something falls totally outside first amendment claimed justice scalia suggested might least material obscene therefore covered without regard new child pornography catalog category vast difference actual child violated picture simulation ferber relied heavily make sentence footnote text simulation outside prohibition prohibition using actual child simulation outside prohibition could provide alternative yes even sentence ferber said touching case actual child simulation outside prohibition could provide alternative used words used words read sentence though opinion mister mr clement finish something great concern seems big step away actual child injury actual child effect viewer thing could said women respect pornography portraying women degrading way thing could said hate speech actual child victim picture talking effect viewer nt things bad effect viewer use simulated children protect actual children exploited ca nt say one much mister mr clement

bestiality masturbation sadistic masochistic abuse lascivious exhibition genitals pubic area government made argument least applied juveniles unprotected speech anyway consists obscenity state federal government free wishes prohibit ferber pretty much said child pornography almost value child pornography different case much like obscenity well mister mr clement mister mr sirkin hear thank mister mr clement case submitted case knowledge lost ground substantial argument okay well question balance raises question tailoring wanted ask appropriate affirmative defense children people depicted fact eighteen nt equally appropriate affirmative defense effect depiction anyone real child eighteen words government interests protected affirmative defense real child case nt comparable affirmative defense simulation effect depending witness say actors fact eighteen maybe produce facsimiles birth certificates maybe produce children whatnot ca nt evidence effect real children used manufacturing film depending witnesses case question proof suppose person steps stand says live children person accused pornography person may something worry convincing affirmative defense defendant problem government problem nt think answers question government sufficiently protected affirmative defense one class cases would nt government problem mean may problem person burden proof carry affirmative

guilty pretty good actually laughter question really would like get one really bothering much question justice scalia asked thing area understand entire area nt miller work obviously set materials justice stewart used refer know see material object communication object certain activity communication society given court decision miller knew answer question would better able deal kind case rather hear directly directly relevant question problem problem trying understand area several cases area coming one want know government read area maybe direct article problem personally judge think justice scalia driving maybe question nt miller work maybe tell contrary experience seems see much material would flunked justice stewart test place seems material parents worried children getting hold knew miller insufficient deal problem would know better deal kind case answer justice oconnor question basically talking overbreadth government argument seems since class materials proscribe fact overly broad respondent problem law works way around show statute precise coverage covers let argument sake although nt think law concede substantially prohibited justice oconnor question directed latter problem seems answering question gravamen question justice oconnor explain question understood substantial area adults play acting roles children covered question government interest precedent judge free speech statute based kind prosecutions government bringing could nt tell whether real child eighteen eighteen could nt tell whether real person would nt difficulty distinction eighteen year old nineteen year old witnesses explain age explain whether computer generated trouble statute would prohibit motion picture company employing eighteen year old actress play three roles justice breyer
