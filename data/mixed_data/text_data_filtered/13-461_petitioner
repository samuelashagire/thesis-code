would distinguish cablevision case applicable assume binding precedent hypothetical want us deal cablevision cablevision case second circuit assume binding precedent assume mister mr chief justice may please court would like begin reinforcing two points mister mr clement made first aereo really functional equivalent congress nineteen seventysix act wanted define public performance chief justice said one potential way looking aereo companies like providing services simply providing equipment sophisticated way viewer plausible way looking world court fortnightly teleprompter said congress acted override make clear cable services services used one big antenna pull broadcast signals sky reroute subscribers people engaged public performances ought paying royalties second thing would like reinforce mister mr clement presentation reason decision case imperil cloud locker services generally mister mr clement pointing term cloud computing guess familiar enough precise details operation let say general terms obviously services provide television programming internet licensed recognize publicly performing particular company instance recorded television programs offered stream anyone paid fee offered stream free make money advertising would public performance companies would providing content people nt think basic distinction one least defines extremes distinction company whether internetbased cable transmitter provides content first instance company provides consumers access content already cloud locker service somebody bought digital copy song movie source stores locker asks streamed back cloud locker storage service providing content providing mechanism watching think would would know details service would making harder call draw line nt pretend bright line providing service providing access equipment look instance extremes person putting rooftop antenna home everybody agrees rooftop antenna manufacturer performing individual engaged solely private performance extreme cable company one big antenna makes transmissions lot people congress clearly intended define private performance somewhere could come lots hypotheticals look less like one extremes somewhere middle authentically hard call draw line nt good answer definition transmit goes transmit performance display communicate device process whereby images sounds received beyond place sent well separate exclusive right thought think answer word transmit used particular sense correct contexts would say person sends cds cds vital albums mails transmitting sense term transmit used talking transmitting way causes sights sounds received transmission radio waves cable et cetera doubt word transmit remember part definition word perform ambiguities definition construed light defined term nobody would say ordinary parlance person transferred copy record performing nt made argument believe existing us us copyright law properly construed fully sufficient comply international obligations nt mean think whenever court misconstrues statute automatically thrown breach certainly possible case decided aereo favor international trading partners might object going take position would concede objections merit making argument thing would make say reinforce point mister mr clement making phrase public using example valet parking using comparable example coat checkroom situations time people place property momentarily disposal disposal another retrieve later distributed later date capacities members public true owners property think kind distinction along lines essential much mundane applications copyright act example invite ten friends watch super bowl private performance public performance friends members public capacities would important regard theater street screening casablanca happened ten people ten people attended would public performance would capacities members public think wide range situations dealing public performance distribution public essential ask individuals members public sense acting capacities pure cloud locker service service nt provide content simply stores content plays back user request service would providing content true owner answer would mister mr clement reasoning cablevision really adhere idea trans performance counts individual transmission ask go one person hard see could rule favor position far bottom line outcome cablevision concerned could accept government position still say cablevision decided correct way precisely cablevision license perform real time broadcast program subscribers thing issue supplemental
