state senate race assembly race called arizona get candidate message electorate would amount public funding period suppose suppose court argument sent letter saying would like file additional brief opportunity going allow opponent file brief would take advantage opportunity said file extra brief opponent also able file extra brief would figure thinking counsel keep want understand exactly claim burden thought circuit courts said evidence candidate actually nt speak nt fund raise law claims contrary briefs us looked nt appear record going start assumption evidence courts candidate stopped speaking stopped collecting money exactly burden otherwise claiming burden burden government choosing give someone else money want go rely davis articulate assuming hypothetical burden delay fundraising delay expenditures choosing spend spend time want collect time want one law telling find advantage correct opponent wo nt speak loud wo nt respond correct mister mr maurer nt objection

public funding accept reject justification increased rather decreased speech think quite right recognizing matching funds court said conflict first amendment matching funds public funding public funding turns states public funding nt used limits low yet state wants conserve public fisc instead increasing amount outset says object economizing giving one lump sum giving installments background number scandals arizona vote buying thought part origin law say nothing corruption thought emerged startling incidents people actually selling votes mister mr maurer suppose suppose government imposes fine five hundred dollars political speech people nonetheless continue engage political speech pay five hundred dollars would make five hundred dollars penalty political speech constitutional nt call subsidy davis recall argument think characterized characterize penalty doubt nt understand hypothetical really nt assume opinion based upon buckley however laughter contrary argue sure public financing cases heard argued asserted purpose level playing field entirely valid purpose unaware public financing laws purpose simply avoid corruption clear however laughter could try understand argument little bit better mister mr maurer suppose know think case bear hypothetical suppose fact deterrent effect speech speech candidate words people thought well know would rather person talks would rather talk silent even means opponent talk deterrent effect law whatsoever would still constitutional objection well constitutes substantial burden even every single person makes choice yes want continue speak chill speak speech suppose sure means constitute substantial burden fact law chill speech fact restriction mister mr maurer restriction speech way around well nt government actually give selective subsidy penalty saying order run effective public financing system speak going give subsidy certain amount trigger trigger penalty triggers subsidy though significant difference davis case expenditure triggered davis discriminatory restriction would never allowed law triggers something justice ginsburg said government could getgo subsidize speech candidate decides participate public financing system particular asapplied challenge independent speakers lawsuit understanding suit brought facial challenge entire law interesting mister mr maurer nt see much difference justice alito hypothetical facts words said justice alito hypothetical would constitutional even though justice alito hypothetical state trying figure much money takes run competitive race giving people enter public financing system amount money exactly state actually accurate way justice alito hypothetical constitutional nt trying thing put sufficient money hands people enter public

lot private money floating around political system candidates public office holders get beholden various people giving money make actions based much receive people idea public financing system try prevent mister mr maurer davis starts saying triggered inequitable contribution limit raised instead contribution raised candidates would perfectly appropriate notwithstanding would put many independent funders real choice independent funder says well taking contributions going help opponent difference case well said davis system system specifically approved davis would disincentivize many people many independent funders speaking would put person choice kind say clients put choice exact kind choice tell take agree justice ginsburg buckley buckley court says public financing means eliminating improper influence large private corporations furthers significant government interest agree says take means right objection much pay trigger quantitatively say okay finance public candidate publicly okay going give million dollars start three million dollars million spend depending much opponents spend think unconstitutional question would constitutional system opinion would helpful interested buckley interested opinion object amount paid installments opinion would constitutional system nt need repeat question want answer answer think joe smith nt much money takes public finance could discourage people brown johnson running going going situation government paying million dollars smith help campaign would discourage person running say file brief people file forget briefs farfetched laughter think would give answer tell truth nt see giving somebody million dollars might discourage poorer candidate running joe guy wants voluntary opponents ca nt anything saying joe takes money brown smith say oh god million dollars forget stay home wo nt run say nt happen never happens okay gather people looked arizona scheme also say think happen never happens either look instances case think law contentneutral within universe applies political speech contentneutral sense within scheme sets contentneutral justice ginsburg hypothetical still trying think suppose one candidate pink party three candidates orange party three candidates orange party received lump sum justice ginsburg talking one candidate side face face three constitutional one person one side three people side arizona law three people side participating candidates gets bonus one person speaking behalf nonparticipating candidate right right ten thousand dollars nonparticipating candidate triggers thirty thousand dollars right justice ginsburg hypothetical would nt problem different terms one candidate faces three people funded government asking theoretical matter whether would constitutional problem case put justice ginsburg hypothetical first amendment think would fair characterization law say purpose effect produce less speech political campaigns thank counsel mister mr phillips thank counsel counsel case submitted
