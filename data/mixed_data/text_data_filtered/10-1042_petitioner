think labeling statute quicken could charge whatever wanted bottom line breaks categories nt something actually attributable one categories violation mister mr russell say agency charge right thinking hud hud successor nt suitcommencement authority injunctive relief purchaser giver statute reads person shall give person shall accept acceptor loan company person giving would consumer customer person gives answerable reading b quicken giver person receives referral kickback receiver mister mr russell one puzzling aspect interpretation would rather large thing congress say going cover overcharges believe hud hud says yet purposes act page one appendix says nothing overcharges nothing payment service received four purpose act four things listed none say stop charges services nt performed hud hud interpretation splitting hud hud position hud hud position says overcharges reached statute say overcharges fee service performed could nt customers said fee service performed reasonable fee rest charge service performed mean maintain distinction overcharge fee services performed policy statement difference unearned reaching nt understand said fast reaching something fees unearned fees whether well suppose lower court could wrong either one two reasons nt decide two precluded considering right mean would well say question presented decides case would say question raised justice breyer decides case right reason put one could mean need mean could mean either part whole two means often decided words associated mean phrase says know tacks nails tacks nails wooden pegs clear nails nt mean toenails means fastener also says portion split percentage seems natural reading portion percentage means could mean whole rather portion statute says shall take portion split okay give example language give would effect deprived effect nothing big accept hud hud interpretation essentially issuance price schedule hud hud anything prices overcharge hence falls provision immense nt reject deference hud hud want us apply ca nt one time one time give deference hud hud yet disagree hud hud says well assume hud hud interpretation criminal statute like must give defendant benefit doubt ambiguity mean standard rule genuine ambiguity find interpretation favors defendant think least ambiguous telling well guess right guess hud hud favoring would defendant case wait minute know charge exorbitant amount cutting tree know two thousand twenty thousand dollars present bill would say earned simply exorbitant nt think evaluate respondent interpretation nt think evaluate reasonableness fee order decide whether earned nt know anybody knowledgeable person applies loan nt ask whether points mean standard mortgage practice somebody says going give eight percent yes eight percent without points mean nt think mere fact interest rate eight percent means ca nt charge points charging points charge service performed service performed giving eight percent rate nt want points came closing say points eight percent agreed would said well eight percent rate give charge two points looks though additional statutory problem two sets verbs statute one give accept set verbs charge made received seems statute thinking first charge made received charge course charge consumer pays provider another transaction transaction give accept transaction transaction occurs two service providers one set verbs refers consumerprovider relationship set verbs refers providerprovider relationship may side issue nt see fee service mean thought points simply way paying money front getting lower interest rate later nt supposed service simply question loan term much borrow interest rate supposed decide theoretically context case involve paying fee service nt exist whether pay service nt exist argument side point way paying money since pay means borrow less interest rate lower borrowed less argument side okay work bank says mister mr smith going charge one hundred dollars courier service nt bill mister mr smith really knowing nt get courier service pays one hundred dollars right nt mister mr smith guilty interpretation mean interpretation every innocent consumer guilty crime nt understand fault would nt says nt get appraisal pay nt nt nt fall within statute got nothing yes yes nt consumer violated bank liable see saying bank writes pay one hundred dollars courier service bank charging courier service consumer pays courier service sees consumer paying courier service paying nothing right nt fall within within statute consumer nt violate circumstances tell briefs read six times get one head briefs explain situation bank would violating consumer would nt since says person shall give well person shall receive well goodness nt briefs maybe track seems pretty obvious question mean statute looks like kickback statute reason looks like kickback statute refers person giving persons receiving seems make equally liable want apply situation nt think want hold consumers liable think explain statute nt reading oh mean prosecutorial discretion words happen consumer rely goodwill prosecutor idea nt want take time important problem problem difference kickback statute could understand well within hud hud expertise normal course good reason price control statute federal agency deciding whether prices accurate service rendered whether percentage represents service nothing rather big novelty american life usually federal agencies system set determining proper prices forth hard believe sort inadvertently congress brought second guise first without big fuss raised big debate forth yes problem problem look saying payment service nt given think might say lower interest higher interest rate expected somebody might say nt get courier service others might say got service goldplated service gold plate nothing see happens get price control statute rather kickback statute concern think least mine say outside reg mean read reg policy statement pretty clear thinking policy statement even clearer thinking overcharges period fiftythree oh five point seven explaining talking third situation say one settlement service provider charges fee consumer work done fee exceeds reasonable value services performed provider exceeds reasonable value services performed provider say reasonable value services performed provider involves agency job deciding fair price particular service see trying make sense agency interpretation says trying change nature statute kickback statute statute protects consumers across board paying things nt get sort interested legislative history said etcetera etcetera much complicated thought coming look lot things part might want say something part mean purpose kind apa apa chevron stuff prevent agencies saying supreme importance mission taking statute running particular transforming criminal law something really nt much procedure important interested whether whether whether gave notice public dear public thinking far kickback statute would like hear think said cases oh nt worry within discretion prosecutor close enough government work hud hud expertise determining criminal statutes sure seems even respondent view statute inquire reasonableness see fee earned argument percentage include one hundred percent certainly true matter logic phrase portion split percentage think natural reading percentage something less one hundred percent words apportioning splitting fee somebody else could portion suppose could still mean full portion split probably mean natural reading surely division reason one objection idea well covers partial must cover one hundred percent different issue talking partial one hundred percent talking partial classic case kickback suddenly say one hundred percent unearned fee much difficult question decide case example get whole bunch things quicken loans including loan stuff kind hard single well part unearned part earned kind whole package portion split entirely different issue yes narrower issue talking portion say kickback goes appraiser maybe decide case whether loan company really anything appraisal alleged unearned fee goes whole loan company little harder say part unearned parts might earned way loans work right mean thing whether pay ten percent points nine percent three points know one earned unearned kind hard sort thank mister mr russell ms ms oconnell mean words rate offered said pay two points get rate eight percent saying even nt pay two points would still get rate eight percent thank ms ms oconnell mister mr hefferon thank counsel counsel case submitted
