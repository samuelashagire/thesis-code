well read read accommodation provision basically maybe maybe let ask question goes issue whether types accommodations would say required meet reasonableness standard let say two categories employees lifting restrictions job descriptions one consists people work alone lift time driver driving truck lift heavy packages time would fall category second category would consist people lift occasionally place always lots employees class available lifting accommodation provided workers second category would say one must also provided workers first nt fit nt second class fit within reading statutory text think reading admitted persons ca nt really read literally read things would read people job classification ca nt also read people whose injuries whose disabilities source really think could prove trial somebody injured recreational activity weekend get light duty pregnant women maybe sorry confused could take basically saying understand okay differentiate basis anything source means whether work nonworkrelated reading legislative history fact congress repeatedly said forcing employers give benefits nonworkrelated injuries going write anyway would please answer question mean source means job job case revolves around nt know source mean otherwise actually think reverse second sentence second sentence says nt worry whether sexes worry whether class people people injured offduty treated differently ability work worry still sex discrimination mister mr bagenstos would case let accept argument sake category people injured duty get light work assignments pointed three large categories let suppose one category nt nt position government took us us postal service policy told government defended policy intents purposes united parcel service briefs called petitioner position frivolous contrived government position explain government suppose day postal service still retains far know exclusion pregnant women favored nations treatment nt read way could read way could could also mean give employees generally give pregnant employees although may special special classes think one briefs example know senior employees driven work unable drive pregnant women would say case assert favored nation provision give benefits give class employees right long nt matter whether class enormous small right record show asserted classes given special treatment almost everybody record show understand favored nation coming favored nation makes sense easy colleague describe write opinion right relieved thought felt nt give deference eeoc eeoc oh oh come one give call kind deference mean gee give even even dissent mean means know treat worth nt give deference give eeoc eeoc though right best reading regardless think guess quite understanding pin get source classifications different category classifications explain suppose suppose mean brief seen truck drivers say nt give many benefits anybody suppose though give benefit truck driver driven particularly difficult mountain pass know gotten danger harm disability lifting precisely source different see came taking truck something special kind favored nation problem nt know source gets say well nt know idiosyncratic see nt know workplaces imagine employers kinds different rules different kinds jobs saying long one job respect let say give benefits one thousand dollars week hurt job others give pregnant women hold different jobs think answer must problem distinguish situation yes exactly single class people see see sound question one seem way given theory mit quite easy way win would bring disparate impact claim thought disparate impact claims nt bring disparate claim therefore nt know want twist disparate know intent claim shape beautiful vehicle bring claim kind articulated win case argument perhaps yes assume nt going help rather selfish laughter job write statute means lot cases writing words means give lot benefits lot employees pregnant women nt give employees pregnant women employer says look pregnant women like nt give lot give employer lose time written us us code nobody knows talking understand need know interpret words would view want said unfortunately takes said fact give lot employees could favored nation two employees including worked four years huge seniority words well start got beginning listed three things said reasonable distinctions word like focus workers problem workers easy construct hypothetical cases work employer treats workers statute nt others distinctions reasonable ones tell used idiosyncratic example interested think illustrates something nt idiosyncratic use illustrate fact employers classes people classes may based kinds different things case classes get benefits equivalent pregnancy nt supposed tell criteria consistent statute found difficult question case ask using idiosyncratic simply illustrate think problem well make sound condition accommodated lifting restriction pregnancy understand case mean way start want want say pregnancy unless missed something well mean think necessary starting point case seems started really giving misimpression would position two thousand fourteen guideline adopted would give interpolation altered phrase words added suppose employer rule disability outside employment give benefits one month applies policy pregnant woman violation statute nothing less nt discrimination basis justice breyer certainly general verrilli would thought types cases present starkest example discrimination basis pregnancy idiosyncratic one oh well yes pregnant woman comes says ah know thing thought maybe sort isolated examples would particularly glaring discriminatory treatment separate category people entitled benefits one month briefly thank general ms ms halligan thank counsel case
