event nt see reason distinct penn central difficulty test value nt sensible response situation posit government nt mean little crazy say government acting crazy therefore ought contribute money net economic effect somehow zero simply transfer taxpayers bear burden opposed somebody else justification giving test would say look substantially advancing interest let government saying test whether government nt kind sensible tendency test suggest government nt even mean seems whole point argument making wo nt hurt landowner quite much nt make sense even get question nt sensible thing say government stop
