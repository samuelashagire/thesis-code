question many different theories floating case hard time trying figure want decide theory want decide allegation secret service agents motivated part security reasons part bad would say bad viewpoint reasons theory secret service motivated viewpoint zero security latter okay latter think hearing government saying yes clearly established could fact motivated bad viewpoint reasons zero security therefore stated claim complaint say agreed wanted say right maybe nt okay would decide case secret secret service motivated security one hundred percent viewpoint state claim running bivens problem et cetera leaving next question would nt heard argued yet raised state claim five years ago would thought nothing absurd claim saying absurd absurd district court could deal would deal giving five

trying decide whether viewpoint ever security justification consider possible situations decide right go antibush crowd probush crowd guns going explosions way go really well respect point adopt general principle say viewpoint never consideration say emergency going likely problem go probush demonstrators anti ones seems face implausible think well may situations viewpoint alone may security consideration well iqbal says little bit allege facts iqbal quoting page six eightyone court goes consider factual allegations complaint determine plausibly suggest entitlement go say given likely explanations plausibly establish purpose based complaint determine whether likely explanations complaint idea front alleyway sixfoot wooden fence certainly look deciding simply whether pled cause action whether plausible justifications said make sure talking fifteen minutes right first first cleared alley right movement concerned nt make sense hypothetically secret service agent suddenly challenge dropped lap last minute say okay thing first thing got clear alley right right standing take care clear alley time assess situation say okay got get people foot alley got move words act emergency situation reasonably quickly step step get back iqbal nt compelling simply likely quote iqbal six eightyone obvious alternative explanation enough matter alleged discovery answer course got allegations going go trial first thing going file interrogatories going file requests admission going file discovery requests secret service district court going allow nt allowed allegations go forward first thing want say first thing want know whether departure established policy first question drafting interrogatories would policy respect moving demonstrators presidential event see secret
