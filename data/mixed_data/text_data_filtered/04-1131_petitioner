well ms ms karlan let put one element client specifically told flra flra bring grievance collective bargaining agreement thought position ms ms karlan nt even ask union justice breyer presenting scenario asks union union says got better things money think position nt ask go directly federal court thirteen thirtyone first looked thought well kind thing resolved grievance level nt even get arbitration right wants survey see picked would redress seemed like kind complaint best handled kind procedure bound concession jurisdictional question nt matter whether government conceded different question still think whether nt agree government question mean question open whether cases say nt speak jurisdictional question regarded decided even even assume von raab decided quite different situation issue nt whether judicial review issue whether judicial review minor grievances even happen involve constitutional issue judicial review provided major employee action judicial review understand available relatively insignificant actions judicial review available nt right could refused could refused search case significant personnel action taken refusing would judicial review whether search constitutional often case order challenge governmental action willing go court resisting search consequence employment nt search citizen connection government search required submit employee describe unrelated employee actions seems unrealistic reason submitted nt would would subject employee action ms ms ms ms karlan indeed serious sure personnel action residual category definition personnel action says significant change duties responsibilities working conditions residual category one specifically named categories get decision order psychiatric testing kind decision could personnel action could nt decision conduct conduct drug test considered personnel action adding residual category end significant change duties responsibilities working conditions consider consider significant change working conditions thought nt undergo drug testing know picked drug testing time would decision order psychiatric testing qualify says right significant change duties responsibilities working conditions implication decision order psychiatric testing significant change duties responsibilities working conditions always good safe agree government never get review statutory claim oh well well nt nt appeal point nt agree mean well ca nt yes simply means grievance procedure valuable case merely talking supervisor issue maybe maybe missing issue nt good reason require go grievance procedure number one cut needless federal court actions number two sort general policy favoring collective bargaining agreements negotiate question would easier case nt require exhaustion two reasons maybe others may right fact may get relief union may say okay going take one well whole right go court constitutional claim absent statute may well get hung sheep lamb going recognize one nt see going much saying got conditional well somebody random thousands people somebody random nobody picked seven times would show nt random know whether good constitutional claim guess rather doubtful maybe many people many people tested try calculate many federal government get bell curve ask library congress hard hard ask someone stanford laughter right regardless beside point right want point get constitutional question maybe go raise claim nt know exhausted et cetera find hard reading believe following like worker mean normally collective bargaining agreement union takes minor things saying although major thing like personnel action special thing get know get court way road complicated individual even though classifies grievance union supposed take union tells going take nt believe claim run federal judge find surprising like explain theory works well nt thing see raising significant question respect least view respect action violates regulation violates statute leave constitution aside might violate number practices good practices et cetera nt focusing thing plaintiff goes union reading page six seven brief says would like invoke arbitration might comes way nt like might file exceptions might win worried nt win nt go court involved unfair labor practice major adverse personnel action worrying take well nt stage nt get court say nt true able come court instances well making kinds arguments making believe millions instances perhaps think something like quite often wrong thought reason exhaustion required always statutes require partly word final apa apa applies well also common law administrative law requires people exhaust remedies rewriting mean mean perhaps right think fine issue seems could dispositive respect nonconstitutional claims want get response simply fair implication congress set nonconstitutional matters system arbitration require client go system seeking get review nonconstitutional matters federal district court normal rule administrative law argument would nt apply case want us hold nt judicial review statute answer please nt mean cut answer want hear answer question agree nonconstitutional matters system nt work client gets review federal district court suppose agree argument requiring exhaust remedy namely request arbitration implication statute right claim answer argument waived could give give answer respect constitutional claim given presence section seven oh five act one forget time raised objection jurisdictional question raised briefs grievance procedure covers took pains point us go grievance procedure necessarily entitled findings written conclusions et cetera reason reason things minor saying grievance procedure nt entitle necessarily findings et cetera go court reason nt get findings know going minor minor things go court seems anomalous even though concede example refused testing fired major personnel action would go statutory procedures bringing constitutional claim review administrative procedures well nt seem odd sort logic fausto cases major action exhaust go court something nt qualify major adverse action get go court right away ms ms ms ms karlan statutory claim essentially mirrors constitutional claim statute requires testing random impartial think difference constitutional claims statutory claims respect treatment csra csra handle exhaust statutory claim constitutional one still nt understand proceed bring go right court constitutional claim even statutory claim go grievance procedure identical claims proceed two different routes thank counsel mister mr stewart get say time laughter thank case submitted think becomes unconstitutional one test become unconstitutional first test unconstitutional many tests period time maybe three three year unconstitutional interrupt fourth amendment violation understand allegations random procedure effect thinks maybe tested frequently people well understand system whole challenged violating fourth amendment take tests would produced purely random selection ever said fourth amendment violation computer malfunctions fourth amendment violation relief requested little testing see whether tested average person understand seem alleging violation fourth amendment
