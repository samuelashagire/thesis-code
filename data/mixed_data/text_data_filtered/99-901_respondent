said going go subjective motivation individual policeman long valid basis stopping car enough nt apply gross applies respect individual traffic stops right cause acknowledged okay stop check driver licenses assuming going beyond allowed stopping check real purpose find drugs stopping cars long takes check driver licenses dog sniffs around car officers really sharp noses would okay laughter mister mr falk nt understand makes difference whether city would done otherwise make difference case surely makes difference defendant convicted drug offense comes says policeman stopped car oh yes stopped defective brake light really nt inquire whether really frankly personally believe often nt really stopped suspicious looking car happened defective brake light nt listen argument nt care primary subjective purpose care long authority stop driver licenses one purposes stop driver licenses difference make another motive wrong city saying look right stop people look licenses police forces time fairfax county stop make sure paid vehicle tax nt course dog sniff around car fact primary purpose may dog sniff around car conducting stop perfectly legitimate stop nt look purpose

seizure look licenses mister mr falk asked miss millett earlier whether dogs ever took longer license check said license check takes three five minutes dog done time license check agree certainly seizures martinezfuerte sitz also seizures primarily entered one claims fiftyone percent harvest martinezfuerte arrested people case came court court say martinezfuerte say main purpose programmatic purpose call could city show without done investigation dog dog search place stop arguably court said correct beyond scope ca nt city state multipurpose stop thought counsel said three purposes thing service point think city would make showing mean city council would pass resolution justifying point mean brought court saying would justify beforehand seems court lower court district court found additional purposes surmised satisfactory district court saying clearly erroneous found bright line read martinezfuerte twice last simply nt find statement seizure primarily regulatory refer language case says ended arresting people say martinezfuerte seizure primarily regulatory asked martinezfuerte says regulatory would say stopping driver license man nt driver license criminal investigatory purpose deemed well also presumption committed crime thank mister mr falk mister mr chinn two minutes remaining guess policeman could walk dog sniffing dog street could nt mean suppose people stopped mean nt bother anybody sniffs dog thought probably lawful would like address particular point confused characterization mister mr chinn said thought stop basic purpose look drugs solicitor general said thought characterization different kind stop stop search drunk drivers stop search licenses unlicensed drivers police would done drugs nothing done like somebody stopping red light people walk dog around well seems quite different considerations case nt point point police set look drugs absence ability would nt set would nt stopped people search police set look licenses alcohol told ca nt look drugs would done anyway say search look drugs solicitor general says nt search going find right concede primary purpose mean absence ability would nt done bringing witness bringing witness look somebody stopped stoplight mean people things like time stop one purpose policeman nt hurt way whatsoever way getting witness somebody pursuing line guess assuming stop done legitimate purpose trouble following assumption secondary mean secondary meant never would done thing nt primary purpose thought little mixed places city stop people checking licenses places city way stop people drunk driving kinds checks know say yes heard solicitor general frankly thought like first cases talking immigration case second case drunk search drug search lower courts treated way indianapolis said purpose secondary suddenly since solicitor general argued think new premise reaching reaching drug search case drunk search plus dog quite different thing issue think important get clear treating drug case one thing drunk case plus dog another last answer accepted characterization second characterization want sure think take think first characterization second seems really arguing difference pretext individual officer acting pretext regulatory program heart case word motive instead pretext reality police work police enforce laws suppose driver license checkpoint stipulated justice hypothesized justice souter police said want add people officers manning license checkpoint experts drug detection would something constitutionally suspicious trained especially look people eyes smell look kinds containers see plain view normal police work permissible permissible adding dog dog efficient may add exactly court said justice oconnor point exactly court said sitz nt need martinezfuerte difference regulatory stop stop probable cause car involved way read sitz want us use von raab analysis sitz said automobiles nt use martinezfuerte analysis would allow dog martinezfuerte stop take easy case simply history indianapolis jurisdiction license roadblock checks twentyfive years suddenly one day drug sniffing dog appears license check would find anything constitutionally suspect use dog well let talking seizure let assume dog simply sniffs sniffs time takes look license greater imposition upon driver use dog would raise constitutional suspicion example gave assumption making implying hypo license check remained fact bona fide license check dogs arrived continued dog arrived make assumption fact bona fide license check made ostensible purpose checking licenses addition dog raise constitutional suspicion raise reason raises question whether still really looking licenses understand guess understand argument say hey look dog appears know longer interested licenses interested something else argument understand assume proved found fact reviewing court license check still bona fide purpose trouble position want go back rationale think started add right reason purpose inquiry understood saying think implying cases like martinezfuerte regular driver checks question purpose case purpose come case justice ginsburg suggested said fact purpose crucial inquiry understood starting say nt make crucial inquiry categories simply collapse way effect stop said way stop short pedestrian search elaborate comes back purpose argument basically saying justice scalia premise accepted circumstances saying purpose crucial characterize way drug search tough question think consistent question assume found fact reviewing court license check registration check fact genuine bona fide purchase purpose simply add dog saying look stopping legitimate purpose anyway check let dog go around dog taint search case reason beyond scope criterion essentially slippery slope reason effect saying premise really unsupportable premise accept premise everybody going wink say checking licenses happen dog premise fact never threat premise true bona fide purpose great nt let dog oh realize pursuing pursuing limits argument justice scalia danger perceive making distinction individual programmatic make distinction say ca nt programmatic rem
