decide case ground one presented question well would ground allow present total winner hands bankruptcy clause presumably allow congress set bankruptcy law way would amount taking property without compensation right would nt allow another constitution violated question whether constitutional protection states sovereign immunity taken away bankruptcy clause whereas provisions clearly right say say state ca nt sued thing saying state sue prevent state suing even though ca nt sue state incompatibility suppose could say intangible contract claim part estate right mean could less reason say

language b b says waived sovereign immunity respect claim governmental unit property estate arose transaction saying ineffective context would effective still nt see distinguish b b nt apply would apply cases mean appealing broader principle either waive sovereign immunity waive none ca nt restrict particular claim b happy halloween laughter well mean trying get rid right would explain okay waiver argument directed claims vmi vmi nt understand answer made much narrower argument making nt nt assert sovereign immunity entire state institutions waived simply claim vmi vmi nt make argument yes said well nt make argument mean hood said make partial one institution understand saying hood said waiver one institution waives whole state hood said yes making separate waiver argument apart abrogation argument nt see would make waiver argument broadly possible separate argument abrogation argument making separate argument making claims state institutions whereas made claims vmi vmi nt understand see see could nt decide favor alternative ground though could laughter well mean distinguishes difference hood go mister mr thro correct assuming preference case like given state bank transfer check tangible object like gold bar would rem jurisdiction part court get gold bar back even though function preferential transfer well respect mean say claim valued dollars mean know getting position distinction drawn contract action preferential transfer point transfers might satisfied might sought least traditional classification would rem rather personam action would answer different gold bar simply sitting desk state purchasing agent opposed deposited state treasury sold state monetary value okay effect saying rem exceptions rem actions exceptions would well normally deal specific performance contract know rem sense talking object mean traditionally rem jurisdiction yes sue effect sue race rather person specific performance contract action sue person assuming sovereign immunity purposes make difference yes mean tougher case sovereign immunity issue make difference theory sovereign immunity believe mean know big fan sovereign immunity circumstances quite sure get around based fact alternative remedy basically making argument uniformity phrase uniform bankruptcy laws essentially argument saying case trumps sovereign immunity gets seminole tribe tell right let suppose right laughter right hard figure direction ca nt tell sound nt know modern system would help right suppose state suppose right worry like response bankruptcies weak firms lot firms weak owe lot money states states figure takes years seep see say settle claims state happen pretty good fifty cents dollar give us money settle month later phhht bankrupt two things happened states got fifty cents dollar every creditor gets five cents dollar month ahead second thing happened creditor firm lost chance come rehabilitated result two bad things bankruptcy law basic purpose treat creditors fairly bankruptcy law basic purpose give firms chance rehabilitate seriously undermined given bankruptcy clause constitution possible say congress power prevent two seriously harmful results harmful terms basic purpose bankruptcy clause tort clause united states constitution contract clause bankruptcy clause thought b right take state nt waived sovereign immunity individual bankrupt might able bring lawsuit damages caused claim wall high something claiming negligent guess person would nt able file fact bankrupt could nt either okay b fact lose right case really turns extent government sorry extent congress waive sovereign immunity seem waived win win lose whole section one oh six would probably fall sure lose whole thing suppose say congress nt power anything wonder b maybe complicated go wrong said wrong answer talking congress tried say lose unconstitutional could constitutional insofar situation state brings case estate offset et cetera would nothing b would reading right light bulb went would sorry trying get case oh okay well nt say exercise sovereign power commerce congress like said mean seems answer conclusory exercise sovereign power congress okay conclusion reason well think waiver argument made properly us may right got let assume one state entity multiple state entities state received preferential transfer dollar two thousand still outstanding claim different claim bankrupt dollar one thousand goes enforce claim dollar one thousand could hold consistently eleventh amendment waiver different claim one state received dollar two thousand worth taxes still dollar one thousand contract claim like get away rem back waiver aspect argued let assume offset obligation state comply preference another claim one entity true seems somewhat unfair say state proceed multiple fronts different entities fractionate immunity three entities three four entities one judged separately offset obligation seems one state entity subject offset otherwise state immunity seems fractionated thought respect justice ginsburg colloquy earlier said offset obligation even different claims want extrapolate multiple entities asserts immunity take time interested well question let say court thinks might merit argument waiver state entity comes asking treated creditor preference bankruptcy court issue preserved question raise say maybe congress used article one abrogate state sovereign immunity seems seem part question presented well asked framed question oh right right exactly right proof claim vmi vmi dollar fortythree thousand preference dollar twentyfive thousand thank counsel ms ms lewis well problem patent area nt yet florida prepaid cases enforced sovereign immunity respect patent proceedings waiver argument one oh six b beyond nt abrogation waiver well question would argue favor waiver statute much limited waiver limits one oh six b well waived much broadly would seem argue waiver one oh six b interpret statute establish congress intended states waive immunity filing claim nt see anywhere statute arguing filing claim state waived immunity nt see statute imposes kind waiver upon states see abrogate immunity different saying waiver argument abrogated immunity turned nt may may authority necessarily imposed waiver okay well waiver sovereign immunity statute thought relying one oh six b waiver immunity relying argument congress imposed waiver okay well informed waiver argument authority abrogate words federal government saying theory abrogating immunity state saying nt authority get informed waiver simply state participates bankruptcy proceeding basis legal theory asserting today congress nt authority abrogate immunity understand theory read brief alternative argument waiver state waived immunity participating bankruptcy proceeding informed waiver argument authority abrogate yes statute abrogate one oh six attempt abrogate turns congress nt authority nt see say state made informed waiver theory guess nt authority abrogate think think safe trick play new chief justices time laughter even yeah even dark laughter well extent argument raised guess long short good sufficient reasons make waiver making today okay thank counsel apologize fireworks laughter mister mr thro three half minutes left thank counsel case submitted may ask reach conclusion bound automatic stay discharge nt also infringement state sovereignty would nt least theoretically possible differentiate setting aside preference one hand bringing suit tort breach contact one could treat assets transferred prematurely hastily whatever call part estate least conceptually possible except congress drawn distinction nt said congress drawn distinction preferential claim contract claim theory second augmenting estate merely preserving estate nt course congress thought successfully abrogated would reason provide waiver nt suppose may ask question another subject talking minute rem theory case understand would contend assets subject fraudulent transfer preference deemed part estate true case also involves claim accounts receivable contend also treated part estate concede effect would part estate adopted rem theory included preferential transfers okay nt fit rem theory would nt able recover waiver theory understand waiver argument defend judgment ground know ground uphold judgment okay respondent would nt tried defend part case waiver theory may ask think within text question presented could decide whether sovereign immunity abrogated convention congress argument know abrogated
