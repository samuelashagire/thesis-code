ask question argument petitioners waived apportionment argument nt many pages district court record parties address apportionment example government response petitioners apportionment argument nt twenty pages findings fact conclusions law issue apportionment dispute ms ms mahoney said costs great deal clean chemicals ones railroad responsible volume volume basis thinking every little detail latest restatement including comments binding cercla cercla case may may ask one question situation two potentially responsible parties ones left right bandb b b bankrupt nobody else identified two one question arranger liability well first apportionment assuming nt accept entire position would remand proof could put sides focusing issue apportionment appropriate questioned district even even apportionment possible questioned arrived true ms ms sullivan said arranger case like one quote arranger seller product excuse say process delivery thought material became property buyer truck arrived saying became property buyer unloaded truck fob fob normally mean think think something misdescription say spillage occurring course delivery think far shell concerned delivery made truck pulled making excuse mean could could adopted means mean control right requiring knowledge using means result spill nt think knowledge alone enough think need purpose arrange disposal think purpose object oil leaking along highway go merely knowing going leaking mean may way statute could find liability part shipper seems ground shipper arranged leak nt want leak knew happening object transport right finding take given indivisible harm dependent question control mean control shell says buyer see delivery made following way nt spill place shell control would nt say buyer effect could either order buyer condition receipt product could require part terms deliverer seems way shell set indicates control passed somebody else moment spigot starts going tank says wo nt sell unless tanks correct okay mean question terms willingness deal basis saying truck pulls hose turned deliver point shell controlling process nt maybe claim sure shell actually could effect get damages deliverer result deliverer incidental spillage position spillage breach contract transporter shell basis saying pursued course action would shell would succeeded shell control well yes saying delivery company would defense saying shell would least theoretical right actual contract deliverer assert control manner delivery would prevented spill saying way could buyer bulk storage nt correct okay mister mr stewart could go back arguing details go back broader question best response argument ms ms sullivan makes arrange disposal implies something significantly different arrange transfer arrange release arrange delivery combination arrangement intentional act disposal opposed one processes implies effect use product intended become exhausted one getting rid waste distinct merely wasting something best answer arguing arguing implication disposal opposed neutral term like transfer delivery whatnot answer oh certainly ways disposal occur think came argument waste management spills things along highway way dump may leakage disposal going fact way getting rid something longer use nt think inclusion leakage within definition answers question whether disposal something different transfer well discharged question whether disposal discharge neutral term mean begs question course disposing sense argues leakage question disposal versus transfer neutral term yes case knowledge nt control using common carrier mean simply control choice process control behavior hauler differ using printer ink cartridge replace mine little thing attached says nt put ordinary garbage bin dangerous whatever put envelope something sure hp hp makes knows several million people wo nt throw garbage bin ship right arrangers oh oh probably millions nt know anybody put right garbage bin laughter different shell shell knows degree people going spill course shell arranged transport imaginary hypothetical nt really know hp hp well maybe hp hp knows particularly bad customer like breyer laughter foolishly admitted dinner dispose improperly shell right suddenly hp hp fact uses guess lease know common carrier imagine suppose car batteries problem trucks use fed ex nt know fact put instruction says really really put special trying find point found far say briefs shell saying easy arranged transport seems common put instructions said right way dispose well nt everybody view company arranges transporter disposal company knows transporter arrival may spill product guess every oil company well mean every liquid product company united states going fall within lot people spill things point point think focusing word nt use word disposal think key word question intention versus purpose trash hauler case seems work pretty well say trash truck course intended sense purpose dispose trash got dump leakage along way purpose deal statute tells us owner facility vessel leaks therefore liable way seems work get example nt seem work import notion intention sense knowing arranger provision point nt see buy get argument point see get every thing clorox shelf supermarket nt put clorox right arranger provision lots companies nt held arrangers problem following say problem ca nt find distinctions made useful distinctions say many wo nt say example car battery manufacturer sends car batteries trucks places people get knows going properly matter hard tries well arranger nt arrange transport disposal arranged transport sale well shell liable knew transportation arrangements well might knowledge one chemical broker careless another way product ultimately sold nt see theory nt make seller liable arranger knows ought know point distribution process likely spillage enter waters united states think argument implies nt see statute mister mr chief justice may please court could begin issue arranger liability ninth circuit distinguished referred useful product cases made clear would impose arranger liability shell simply theory shell sold useful product later disposed way contaminated environment rather court appeals district court emphasized shell control delivery process shell knew district court put leaks spills inherent chosen method nt think would nt think would arrangers disposal even though might foresee first think ordinary tort law principles seller knowledge certain percentage products would misused would sufficient give rise liability two differences first hp hp might know percentage customers would dispose material improperly district court found shell knew spills leaks occurred every delivery second second difference shell arranged delivery controlled circumstances delivery would made shell hired common carrier shell required bandb b b bulk storage facilities dd would pumped delivery truck bulk storage think certain point product used customer well fact circumstance shell common carrier transferred control dd bandb b b instructions used later date customer violated instructions fact pattern spills occurred process delivery return justice alito hypothetical asked shell deliberately chose particular delivery company knew would result spills economic advantage exactly case prior time dd shipped bandb b b facility sealed drums whatever possibility might misused later would nt spilled leaked process delivery transfer shell decided economic advantage require bulk storage dd district court specifically declined make finding says fob fob delivery place delivery district court found bandb b b acquired called stewardship property time truck entered premises district court well district court specifically declined find make finding owned dd time spilled nt think argument dependent upon question ownership shell undeniably ownership possession dd time arrangement made correct would true paradigmatic arranger case one company generated waste hires hauler pick take away parties could easily provide contract title would pass hauler time garbage knowledge might well sufficient knowledge control well ms ms sullivan said instructions given nineteen seventyeight fairly far period contamination even date shell control sense required bulk storage bandb b b facility contract common carrier required common carrier particular equipment pumping dd truck bulk storage facility control process sense defining way done correct actual process unloading done employees common carrier employees bandb b b rather employees shell whole point arranger liability allow people set motion process culminates disposal get hook well think shell pursued cause action delivery company might well argued foreseeable mean point shell would succeeded suit delivery company would argued successfully known inherent consequence delivery process shell chosen well certainly insisted contract use pumping equipment pump dd truck bulk storage facility correct use analogy essential theory point arranger liability provision get situations one person sets motion mean guess would know hypothetical circumstances disposal occurred guess nt really understand hypothetical nt understand situation shell would indifferent whether product bought product competitor bought agree term arrange connotes intentionality think satisfied shell intentionally set motion process delivery insisted upon delivery done particular fashion knew spills leaks inherent process use analogy point would make term disposal specifically defined include spilling leaking use couple analogies think know car leaks oil whenever operated choose drive public highway think could naturally said intentionally discharged oil onto highway may well well term disposal specifically defined include spilling leaking right one true situation instance trash company hauling waste intended dispose classic sense dumping landfill along way truck leaked items spilled think everybody acknowledges disposal think would also say company contracted trash hauler knowing vehicle tended leak trash every delivery could said arranged ultimate disposal following think court appeals dealt said holding suggest every manufacturer useful product liable road customer ultimately disposes mean think sense argument liability would depend part assumption people systematically violate law like would easy thing court say assume impose liability basis assumption battery customers systematically violate law second thing would missing hypothetical even battery manufacturer assumed know every one customers would dispose ultimately improper way battery manufacturer would control process manufacturer control use batteries ultimate disposal would severed turned case think return purposes arranger liability provision operator liability provision deals well people undertake actual disposal congress evidently thought enough think combination knowledge control knowledge might sufficient knowledge control together form basis arranger liability know particular common carrier uses truck use variant earlier hypothetical know particular common carrier uses truck leaks oil whenever operated highway contract carrier ask haul goods think naturally said arranged discharge oil control sense deliberately selected mode delivery particular common well control sense using personnel drive truck shell control aspect process resulted spills leaks well could adopted means insisted upon particular means clearly court reads term arrange require purpose lose case purpose transaction knowledge control terms fairness shell think worth noting typical arranger setting person asks trash hauler come pick trash deposit appropriate place arranger ultimate liability may determined substantially steps hauler takes afterwards arranger believes trash going disposed safely fact hauler dumps way contaminate environment arranger nt used word waiver brief concede railroads shell least cursory way raised issue apportionment trial ninth circuit found sufficient preserve view like case party burden proof particular issue asserts particular proposition true fails introduce sufficient evidence carry burden would nt speak waiver still failure party come forward enough carry day think would acceptable approach think well guess would two responses first although district court certainly believed district judge believed building margin safety view still speculative whether railroads share contamination exceeded less nine percent fundamental point one raised one questions ultimate harm government practical sense incurrence response costs general way damages measured cercla cercla case nt ask threat degree public threat public safety posed contamination ask much cost clean well think nt think record kind establishes relative costs different contaminants understood ms ms mahoney say understood say cost remedial action proportional mass chemicals removed dispute proposition railroads expert doctor dr kalinowski testified remedial action government time contemplating referred pumpandtreat system water would pumped aquifer would treated granularactivated carbon gac gac method removing contaminants water could pumped back doctor dr kalinowski said amount gac gac would needed implement remedy would proportional mass chemicals involved crucial point purposes treatment gac gac small portion pumpandtreat remedy essential drill wells pump water treat prior remedial approach pump back think first preliminary point reason think cost remedy whole would proportional mass contaminants substantial fixed costs point would make insolvency bandb b b really seems us become crucial solvent defendants evidence showed remedy government implemented would less ten percent contamination thirty percent contamination one hundred percent contamination much costs fixed costs reducing volume really going affect cost meaningful way solvent defendants might still case dividing costs proportion contamination caused would rough justice well believe first answer cost remedy would proportional amount contamination disagree nt think doctor dr kalinowski testimony bears said amount granularactivated carbon would necessary proportional mass contaminants well first point comment h right nt cite cases say insolvency defendant need prevent apportionment would provide basis exceptional cases view exceptional case would one ultimate determination cost remedy amount relevant harm would less even one defendant contamination issue well would say even ten twenty percent established remedy government would required implement source contamination leakage railroad parcel established government could cleaned ten percent twenty percent cost remedy actually chosen might sound basis apportionment despite insolvency bandb b b big point least government left holding bag costs would required incur railroad parcel source contamination nt findings either way district court framed relevant inquiry percentage contamination attributable railroad parcel shellcontrolled deliveries bandb b b parcel made finding one way cost remedy would source contamination railroad parcel certainly primary equitable thrust argument side unfair make us pay somebody else contamination extent government would required implement remedy costly even sixty percent costly railroads shell source contamination imposing least amount liability asking pay bandb b b contamination simply asking pay response costs well indeed second restatement says categorical matter either two causes would independently sufficient bring result joint several liability example restatement gives two merging fires destroyed building think established second restatement apportionment either two causes would brought feared harm respect third restatement would say least case right exact counterpart comment h third restatement least indivisible harms think potentially indivisible harm government would required undertake less response action regardless source contamination least individual harms third restatement gives variety approaches local jurisdiction could take joint several liability pure several liability several permutations third restatement nt think take given defendants burden prove divisibility think nt regard defendants burden nt believe evidentiary basis feeling confident one way whether harm indivisible respect nt think court norfolk western dealing different statute said looking restatement important state law congress enacted statute rather commonlaw principles said brief think reason second restatement crucial document look third restatement one things would find drafters indivisible harms identified variety approaches local jurisdiction could take expressly declined choose preferred one among said important determinant choosing risk particular defendant insolvent allocated drafters third restatement certainly nt treat insolvency factor ignored citing questions apportionability correct guess true argument sketching crucial question response costs government would required bear railroad parcel contamination issue argument railroads failed prove divisibility another option would remand factual proceedings address question think arranger case going either direction fours one sale useful product course delivery seller arranged seller controlled question apportionment really position precision would require big fight whether ten percent responsibility thirty percent way tell parties said look take forty percent good nt happened mean whatever guess railroads said six percent district court said well safe side give nine percent still nt address question varying degrees whatever want call fault causal relationship sensible way apportion liability well ms ms mahoney three answers asked question also said restatement comment h rely cites cases third restatement backs away comment nt nt think insolvency prevent apportionment situation party one percent responsible ninetynine percent responsible party insolvent way findings question right mean nt nt challenging whole basis apportionment mean nt think apportioning responsibility allocate whether actors independently caused harm thought assumption yes everybody group contributed harm going apportion responsibility thank counsel ms ms sullivan give five minutes time spill may ask essential theory shell title material delivery fungible product purchaser agreed take either product quantity quality forth could substitute goods another source would shell still liable well shell gave instructions gave nt insist product rather somebody else another oil company product well
