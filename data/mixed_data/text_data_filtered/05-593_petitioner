case mister mr haley said conversations private employer plaintiff name mentioned conversations never told discharge would would something would argument apply position attorney general certification conclusive conclusive situations attorney general nt draw line properly event denying answer event characterizing answer whenever attorney general wrong nuanced decision instances attorney general certification conclusive say attorney general certification conclusive purposes removal mention remand relation case removed attorney general certification whereas contrast attorney general nt certify case removed statute address issue remand put two things together nt perfectly clear congress want cases removed attorney general certification remanded wholly state law claim principal matter whether federal employee immune suit threshold question answered determined wholly federal law must get federal law gateway go place else suit never happened though federal employee hong kong premises claiming whatever within scope authority seems like question phraseology dealing well mean problem argument mister mr grant life things often happened nt happen middle ground officer saying relevant time place everything within scope employment nt anything outside scope employment suppose mister mr grant district court said going deny substitution united states defendant realize debatable question going order remand defendant united states chance challenge initial ruling deny substitution united states suppose happened way would right get back state court would nt properly go court appeals well suppose happened court appeals said united states substituted defense job everything job within scope employment left question justice scalia raised ambiguous employee says everything within scope employment nothing improper allege something improper nt faithful servant negligent employee allowed federal forum one loyal careful employee state court make sense employee said never one thing inconsistent federal employment nt understand anyone would want come way urge us come would make sense give federal employee benefit trial federal court committed act debate whether whether liability yet deprive benefit federal court denies anything would want one set cases remain state court set cases go federal court well mean debating whether line seen discussion least ambiguity ambiguity find line nt make sense happen fact certification attorney general turns wrong nt immunity still whole thing going tried federal court mister mr grant items discussing perhaps important features case argument brief nt begin began assertion jurisdiction review district court remand order take abandoning first brief first argument would thought answer would even even remand improper even case nonetheless erroneous remand still remand covered prohibition review mean said cases even remand wrong remand reviewable answer go back main issue second would thought case unfortunately mind classic case jurisdiction ag ag supposed say look nt think anything happened okay job day something happen tell within scope employment apparently say got mixed courts words made phone calls even mentioned employee even said something improper within scope employment said seems makes lot complexity nothing explain answer district court nt say something happened scope employment thought maybe nt thought ask district court thought said well first argue defense alternative think nothing happened plaintiff convince jury otherwise fine convince within scope employment happen district court said something like well ca nt wood says anybody know thinks valid problem would thought reason case appears difficult case ag ag able come remove wrong nt mean wood issue issue anything happened course outside scope like one employee shoots another know nothing scope employment plainly outside course act view act allows ag ag defend kind thing arguable least something happened happened within scope employment ag ag defend problem problem say point view saying abandoned argument mister mr grant little puzzled discovery federal system less valuable state system nt summary purpose deciding whether removal proper think justice ginsburg point concerns well government entitled say time event occurred well question district court examine statute talks incident claim arose necessarily requires government look complaint see incident claim arises whether claim true certify claim arose seems importance dissenting judges first circuit case wood nt think important sure right actual statutory language refers acting within scope employment time incident certification based view time alleged incident acting entirely within scope would seem within language statute well mean line awfully difficult draw assert nt versus something else easy let say assault case person says hit person says well entirely accident gesticulating hand nt would nt met requirements tort denying incident case characterization something example mental element plaintiff assert malice aforethought defendant say nt characterization denial incident deciding whether removal thought statute says attorney general certification conclusive respect removal well mean say certification conclusive respect scope employment purposes removal nt mean conclusive going judicial review going address question removal opposed validity certification merits saying conclusive right least considerable tension fourteen fortyseven nt look twentysix seventynine suggests think case would proceed federal court rather immediately remanded without availability review different type jurisdictional statute concern congress part provide federal forum adjudication whether something within scope federal employee duty inconceivable would seem illogical specifically provide review determination review take place state court rather federal court thank mister mr grant mister mr hallwarddriemeier well nothing expressed thermtron yet recognized exception thank mister mr grant case submitted nt denial element claim recovery assault mental element chief justice described hypo fact element claim draw distinction existence nonexistence act well asking certain cases want know analytically think supposed well case immunity defense number one said government forthrightly said beginning right terms statute acting within scope employment secondarily said government effect elaborated said reason acting outside scope employment acts would outside scope nt happen different claim chief justice hypo intent harm claim upon immunity depends immunity claimed immunity claimed time question acting outside scope employment reason acting outside scope nt say
