size device size device put license place would technical trespass property driver well would draw line suppose gps gps used track somebody movements one day twelve hours three hours would right put aside put aside trespass question well sounds like legislative line difference following somebody twelve hours let say monitoring movements gps gps twelve hours would say latter first argument problem latter former would reason difference terms one privacy whether followed police officer twelve hours nt see officer whether monitored gps gps twelve hours know nt know society expects think changing technology changing people expectations privacy suppose look forward ten years maybe ten years ninety percent population using social networking sites average five hundred friends allowed friends monitor location twentyfour hours day three sixtyfive days year use cell phones would expectation privacy well maybe good way decide case wonder would mister mr jones anybody else really upset found police sneaked car put inert device size credit card underside car would say fact police wasting money nt even see little wafer put car nothing one nothing would go would sue would bring trespass action concerned little thing put car invasion property interest monitoring takes place warrant warrant case puzzling aspect case maybe irrelevant present purposes warrant two violations violations statute rule neither may carry exclusionary rule sanction exclusionary rule penalty clear violation fourth amendment little strange deciding whether warrantless search would unconstitutional warrant point point violation ten day rule violation statutory prohibition maybe rule prohibition judge district ordering installation district fourth amendment requirements warrantless intrusion warrant think look lower court case law find violation ten day rule necessarily violation fourth amendment nt vitiate warrant warrant nt necessarily dissolve evaporate ten days expire maybe cases wrong going dramatically different next step satellites look hone home block neighborhood nt see far future cameras going able show entire world let track somebody camera place place give us theory okay police access cameras look moving place place okay okay theory case think twentyeight satellites unworkable rule tethered principle unworkable rule tethered principle thousand video cameras may may okay depending large city would nt would nt protected surveillance camera could get information really different kind surveillance camera think conceded sides accepted sides warrant expired warrant government certainly could gone back said judge nt make need little time give us ten days nt license plate nt know know laughter know paid license plate well ridiculous look give state permission put license plate carry car carry state license plate give anybody permission car carry tracking device whether put directly car directly something car carrying nt seem make difference nt make seizure nt make seizure makes search mean say trespass purpose obtaining information makes search nt see seizure seizure bring something within control stop person stop vehicle seized slap tracking device car case involving seizure data floating air opposed papers well must unconstitutional scary laughter mean scary provision article mister mr leckar discussion going questioning leads seems leaps difficult part case issue us abstract whether police conduct unreasonable unreasonableness requirement unreasonableness prohibition take effect unless search cases said search public everything open view people hard question case whether unreasonable fourth amendment says police ca nt anything unreasonable lot stuff unreasonable without violating fourth amendment protection legislature establish going go katz invasion privacy showing car going public streets police could roundtheclock surveillance individual whole month two months three months would violated anything would invasion privacy invasion privacy one hundred times zero equals zero invasion privacy one day invasion privacy one hundred hundred days may unreasonable police conduct handle laws invasion privacy matter many days invasion privacy tail tail police surveil surveil month excellent yes course legislature take care whether invasion privacy pick five days air ca nt five days ca nt fifty people time take care stuff ca nt decision fourth amendment nt precisely kind problem rely upon legislatures take care nt see congress business purely intrastate operation congress control police practices nt violate fourth amendment throughout country mean maybe interstate interstate beepers interstate tracking devices yes long track within within state nt okay mister mr leckar guess sure quite understand argument trespass accomplished matter put somebody car somebody overcoat could put nonworking device somebody car would still trespass surely constitutional problem raised get trespass constitutional problem difference really told maybe wrong told somebody goes london almost every place person goes camera taking pictures police put together snapshots everybody time different ask justice alito question different way suppose police could without ever committing trespass suppose future cars going gps gps tracking systems police could essentially hack system without committing trespass would constitutional issue face different violation unless addition search unreasonable search since already true seizure nt already everybody agrees least search care whether case called karo says whether trespass nt really matter question reasonableness think mean argue trespass much want still mind reasonable think question debating would like know saying parade horribles worry worry comes police many many people suspect kinds things ranging kidnappings lost children terrorism kinds crimes willing go far reasonable suspicion pinch say least avoid nineteen eightyfour scenario fact allow police work subjecting person really good knowledge going open highway probably put better appreciate views fact cameras london actually enabled watched got impression track bomber going blow airport glasgow stop many people say kind surveillance worthwhile others like say bad thing nt issue exactly front us justice kagan wanted know oh goodness sorry expression reading existence physical trespass marginally relevant question whether fourth amendment violated however actual trespass neither necessary sufficient establish constitutional violation karo talk like hour would really interested hearing assumption real issue whether reasonable take congress way mean say general search kind constitutional fourth amendment congress pick subset thereof say terrorism reasonable cause like fisa fisa court special courts issue special kinds warrants different question could decide later time negative way mean way favors result looking way going congress create situations rather situations ca nt nt need get live free die costfree suppose police department says got two things put thirty deputies route watch person device warrant difference make suppose got nothing would thirty deputies staked along route get thirty deputies constitutional violation well assuming initial trespass problem case saying quantity information seized time seized proposition testing seems saying police use inefficient methods fully aware nineteen eightyfour ministry love ministry peace problem argument seems principled distinction case put mixing mixing two things one thought position initial trespass important narrow way decide issue nt want us ask karo say oh well trespass responsive answer lots communities including washington cameras intersections stop lights suppose police suspected someone criminal activity computer capacity take pictures intersections drove different times day checked movements routes five days would lawful think would targeted invasion period time long wide space seems seems answer question yes consistent said earlier nt nt hear answer justice alito question position placement gps gps device stateowned license plate understanding correct state license plate require trespass theory would seem falls apart respect particular scenario size credit card slip behind license plate thought made difference theory focused question trespass attached effect owned somebody else effect owned individual trespass theory anyway nt seem ridiculous know well gets back justice scalia question got determine search first impose warrant requirement seems warrant requirement applies respect searches right okay seizures might seem like good idea impose requirement particular technological device still establish search pushed pushed friend limits theory theory take would apply going three minutes right car push button three minutes say still fourth amendment violation nt talk long going information test validity theory proposition violates fourth amendment three minutes said several times tell mean nt know society expects suppose ask people think violation privacy police reason month maybe would come one way asked people think police probable cause monitor five minutes movements somebody think going set huge bomb maybe get different answer thank counsel mister mr dreeben five minutes
