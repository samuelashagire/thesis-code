advising police probable cause husband probably exigent circumstances well keep saying policy vindicated using doctrines consent want us think want us say think say general social expectation person wants entry overrides person nt also agree justice scalia social expectation may part measured cases subject nt see interest occupant allow entry interest must necessarily overridden want us take position legal difference thank counsel mister mr dreeben curious though way fact cut see argument closer relationship reasonable say one party less recognizes privacy interests held hostage views get
