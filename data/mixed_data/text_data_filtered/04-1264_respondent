tell congress want create separate offense nt reasonable reading violence course achieving purpose achieving object question opposed effect byblow bystander like get meaning hobbs act try focus thoughts saying two objections arguing related passed hobbs act section two section two said act forbids robbery extortion involving interstate commerce robbery extortion involve property section five section five said act forbids physical violence threats violence related section two happened since recodification recodification nt meant change anything substantive second related point enmons thirtyfive years working people country thought right strike free hobbs act interpretation aflcio points gut right strike two strong arguments like hear response jurisdictional hook nt see something criminal statute forbids affecting commerce means congress wants prevent conduct follow words needs jurisdictional hook puts affecting commerce always understood federal criminal code wrong mister mr want give chance quite right thinking moved large part worried large part language change federal criminal law change federal criminal law right way beyond case would transform virtually every threat violence made anywhere united states serious federal crime least would make major change threats violence picket line two aspects thing worried upsetting expectations way outside context case making major change federal labor law example nineteen fiftyone c yeah perhaps old statute nineteen fiftyone c something brand new yeah right well case interpreted hobbs act enmons seems rely laborunion exemption fact threat violence effort obtain legitimate wages within act read legitimate wages act guess would left threat violence wrong says affect commerce therefore instance threat violence affects commerce becomes federal crime subject twenty years imprisonment course today world know believe almost everything affects commerce even close right major incursion federal law serious criminal federal law could fairly minor matters state criminal law look typically enter judgment last time well also said last paragraph predicate acts supporting jury verdict says predicate acts supporting jury finding rico rico violation quite clear referring anything reading hobbs act nt covered face face act know terms specific legislation addressed specific context acts complaining original suit actionable face face act nt well also said nt assume substantive change recodification argument requires us assume congress intended substantive change recodified hobbs act enacted model penal code well friend answer implied rightofaction case therefore remedies spelled assume broader remedies wrong answer well congress never discussed change hobbs act proposing nineteen fortyeight laughter thank mister mr chemerinsky mister mr untereiner three minutes remaining well nt think would actually enter judgment might reverse instructions lower court enter judgment would nt enter
