point question course may well campaign among students chosen situation respond justice kennedy could offcampus well case decided term dealing submitting student election participation use student fees certain purposes expressed concerns mechanism nt well mechanism school organizing majoritarian vote determine unusual sort arrangement nt think addressed anything like well presumably mechanism approved thing could done every classroom every day let students decide day speaker day start class forth think know look extended application concept restraints well little precise constrained example could message break necks make wrecks buckle boys mister mr sekulow would comply equally well school district said football big event school district everybody comes game friday night want everybody registered voters adults school students interested going electorate registered voters people come forward volunteers thing substitute student body high school electorate district would equally constitutional whoever school district says would like democratic possible want use democratic process mister mr sekulow nt think perhaps nt convey clearly enough meant registered voters think shied away sounds like government designating electorate student students acting individually voting students body electoral body school district designated decisionmaker general neutrality may ask repeated mister mr sekulow think justice kennedy opinion rosenberger defined neutral criterion way said must good reason believe time criterion yield expression reflecting whole spectrum political speech going assert facial challenge neutral criterion reason believe case time see result policy state initiated full spectrum speech resulting well one speech policy school board adopted bringing cases religious group one among many whoever speaks one speaker one else talk another equal access nt one alone one among many policy turned every speech invocation including deity would say asapplied challenge student speaker least record brief effect says going try disguise want say prayer going fact nt even sue establish right say prayer switching point making nt somewhat imaginary say wait told going honest want give prayer message well guess justice kennedy problem would eliminated school simply said captain football team shall deliver solemnizing message invocation thing know fiddled arrangement nt achieved whole lot perhaps could say student highest grade something else would nt election would okay guess lee v nonsectarian religious could though whereas policy must allow student wishes invoke jesus christ say hail mary anything else real mr distinction prayer violating first amendment proselytization matter criticizing religion violating first amendment general assert facial challenge fail simply necessarily case whatever student selected deliver prayer religious invocation alone enough defeat facial challenge surprised general assume statement rosenberger said full spectrum political speech focused political speech policy school put place intended foster limitedpurpose forum case think would defend would full spectrum solemnizing solemnizing speech would students saying know let pause memory members football team last year got killed car crash whatever would want defend proposition manner political speech would mean surely manner political speech would nt allowed case solemnizing speech nt adopt wooden rigid rule still looking mechanism ensure neutrality keep divisiveness nt seen case may weakness rosenberger nothing seems point raised well mister mr sekulow general cornyn hear yes may shortly thank general cornyn mister mr griffin hear thank mister mr sekulow laughter would rather establishment clause problem somebody chose speak subject religion bunk mean comport sure solemnizing football game assuming process laughter would comport yes history soon place give one prayer case back right basic substantive argument mean understand mean prayers public places called invocations congress inauguration president forth gather texas big community event take one saying reason could invocation god name mean right worrying look establishment clause point view mechanism seems school district figured way prayer mechanism seems leave minority religions mean instead general prayer something reflected majority view understandable point view saying bad speech saying though would nt minority person likely left policy advocate today even policy said kind nondenominational prayer like invocation okay true purpose establishment clause allow families raise children religion choice schools favoring one religion another giving kind message nt contrary purpose think first amendment problem rule prohibits campaigning would rather strange relying rule may ask question sure mind person elected gives solemnizing invocation every football game home right whatever repeated messages school disapproved first message person gave person could continue give message say used foul language message example could tell next time supposing made appeal one particular denomination say ninety percent people school mormons made specific appeal people religion could suggest next time well right within squarely within language policy could suggest maybe gone overboard little bit even overtly sectarian let ask mister mr sekulow conserve time state concern rather ask series questions assume election offered us saving feature program yet election nt mean anything without campaign campaign seems students might say good speaker representative school welltrained wellmotivated give inspirational prayers another student poster saying prayers school school election based issue whether prayer kind thing think establishment clause wants keep schools school electoral mechanism governmental mechanism selecting speaker one criteria think whether prayers going given finish seems avoiding question hard question give prayer well student goes community representative school think would want ongoing supervision regular faculty encourage students go community affairs sure faculty ought selecting speaker five members sitting around faculty committee encourage young person give prayers nt seems question ought answer well nt much southworth already predicate already invasion first amendment rights corrective whole question ab initio rights seems concerned avoiding schools becoming forum religious debates one thing could say unconstitutional illegal say prayer never costly intervention school seeks go community understand think election thing nt work reasons suggested justice ginsburg asking thought answer justice scalia would yes completely sufficient nt know policy going maybe nobody laughter tell maybe important would solemnize football game thought least would require religion require religious messages sound religious say solemnization secular invocation well nice speech normally mean invocation one problems seems case one problems premise argument assumes language see face policy descriptive fact going candid say seems asking us shut eyes sequence provisions practice shows sequence provisions shows started student chaplain invocation lawsuit brought student chaplain became speaker invocation gained alternative noninvocation seems nt realistic basis suggest anything different going intended go went intended go lawsuit facial challenge required close eyes context language come nt wait specific application e nt wait nt close eyes context policy arose well mister mr sekulow even first question nt sure understand nt find enough answer assuming student chosen exercises student choice pray still faced system school school district provides forum going appear requires attendance certain number students therefore requires students sit prayer going need decide establishment assuming assuming sake question criterion accepted neutral taking next step saying student given neutral option chooses use option pray school district forcing schoolchildren sit participate praying ceremony seems far go decide case even premise talking neutral choice engage kinds speech going example rosenberger nt accept characterization court characterization law neutral speech policy premise question discussion religion merely religious subject matter religious worship act religious practice private speech question whether speech effect involuntarily inflicted upon may want power let assume stay topic taking justice ginsburg question limited think asking factual question question precedent question fact could expected let add footnote question reason anyone would expect would get solemnizing speech effect religion bunk question reason going apply definition neutrality assuming appropriate reason believe time kind spectrum expression religious subjects going occur mean point question nt think reason expect going speech football games saying religion bunk
