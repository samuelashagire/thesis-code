whether dispossession well nt taxes talking jurisdiction parcels land mean taxes one aspect saying land longer belongs new york state well rested upon session wisconsin happens suppose want follow suppose nt evict people twentytwo square miles center new york state lot land maybe worth trillion dollars nt know mean indian tribe would would mean would right let say hundreds billions dollars

part would like response take answer yes entitled value right answer say merits claim three hundred thousand acres eighteen thirtyeight treaty buffalo creek three hundred thousand acres nobody paying attention tribe members lived language treaty circumstances says home illinois kansas home kansas nation place heard language cited even though person says live long want means live long want nt mean reservation reservation sovereignty may gone kansas though course nobody move unless struck fair bargain agreed state new york take argument want hear response yeah well may true wondered damage part still thinking trespass action trespasses occurred eighteen fifty seventeen hundred worth millions today even tiny interest passage time et cetera add value land thinking numbers astronomical yet nt happened actually thinking nt damage action far serious simply taking property tax rolls want know practice works congress power example deal considering case simply negotiating position strengthening people hands vis vis legislation going like strange thank mister mr smith mister mr stewart thank mister mr stewart case submitted would odd give assurance could buy back lost would strange construction representations intendant upon buffalo creek understand talking five thousand acres mister mr stuart one question buffalo creek hold buffalo creek nt disestablish reservation nt new york indian case rest false premise case gave dollar two million failure give kansas lands justice stevens may please court would like address first city argument long passage time renders improper give tribe tax exemption lands recently purchased argument wrong three reasons first correct tribe federally protected title seventeen nineties federal protection never validly extinguished fact tribe possession relevant lands nearly two centuries distinct substantial legal wrong would adding insult injury say precisely tribe suffered initial injury disentitled take advantage tax exemption would otherwise flow possession well think think important distinguish two different types delay issue oneida ii ii delay bringing underlying lawsuit even context court said suit barred entirely equitable factors might taken account formulating appropriate remedy nt delay filing lawsuit nobody doubts tribes asserted right tax exemption promptly repurchasing relevant land argument side delay purchasing land analogized court held tribe tribe may abandon aboriginal title land court also held congress creates reservation confers explicit federal protection particular lands reservation diminished disestablished act congress ca nt terminated adverse possession respect question whether delay buying land analogized delay think reservation would remain reservation mister mr smith pointed respect parcels within reservation owned indians tribe regulatory authority extremely limited therefore tribe would able exercise anything like plenary regulatory jurisdiction whole two hundred seventy thousand acres court atkinson trading montana versus united states said tribe may able regulate conduct non indian lands extent conduct involves voluntary transactions tribe members extent regulation necessary order protect tribe sovereignty land possesses agree atkinson trading makes clear even great bulk land tribe members tribe ability regulate conduct non indian parcels sharply limited would doubly true tract nature return point state reliance interest think city reliance interest think important stress case taxation municipality ca nt claim sort reliance interest able tax potential defendant true congress power deal end court opinion oneida ii ii court expressed confidence point borne congress would fix problem well bureau indian affairs recognized tripe along treaty canandaigua federal government required pay annuities treaty cloth six nations federal government done continuously since beginning always recognized tribe think put finger important point justice breyer court oneida ii ii said hoped congress would fix problem thought would said even congress nt legislate solution suit go forward court contemplated equitable considerations could taken account formulating remedy certainly nt contemplate tribe end day would left without remedy point tribe sue damages seems farfetched think would nt able reassert tax immunity court said court said general matter matter federal law tribal merchant tribal land required collect sales taxes non indians least purchase goods purchased reservations mean taxes thing issue thing issue case agree holding parcel reservation would implications regulatory jurisdiction well nt categorical rule federal law says states localities absolutely regulate conduct tribal lands within reservation rather preemption test certainly thumb scale favor exemption state local regulation tribal reservation lands well court new york indians ii ii recognized start treaty affected immediate session oneida wisconsin lands federal government court specifically noted session would sufficient consideration support contract private parties simply nt correct say new york oneidas gave something promise remove second mean references primary inducement federal government entering treaty desire compensation strictly kansas lands denied important note senecas got mean nt nt held promised made commitment remove new york clearly analyzing rested part upon session wisconsin rested part fairly technical argument effect grant kansas lands en presente present grant kansas lands therefore new york indians could disentitled lands forfeiture established court looked article three treaty determine conditions forfeiture said federal government would required allege forfeiture legislative judicial act et cetera thing really wanted point wanted make reliance interest taxing jurisdiction matter long particular tract taxable may finish always within realm city contemplation may bought tomorrow federal government church tax exempt entity consequently municipality sense repose remain taxable thank oneidas claim tax current property owners positive indication nt remember new york case would fact ceded anything new interest new york distinct wisconsin land entering treaty came compensation indication compensated anything kansas land obtained result ceding wisconsin land indication got kansas anything wisconsin correct indication ceded anything respect title new york okay
