well question law involved whether liberty interest sandin case nineteen ninetyfive court said prisoners statecreated liberty interest deprivation restraint imposes atypical significant hardship inmate relation ordinary incidents prison life guess categorized category five state involve putting someone solitary confinement reducing time exercise reducing options parole well take nt simplify telling us whether take position today liberty interest know asking opinion wanted talk first preliminary question think started say regarded atypical significant factfinding made based extreme conditions kind confinement nt see another human perhaps concrete suppose charge gang leader get notice says considered reclassification gang leader reclassified reason reason reclassified gang leader words gang leader get predictive judgment person gang leader ultimate decision given facts circumstances predict person among worst worst findings made along way necessarily predictive mean would nice issues came simply divided happened past might happen future judgment made classify someone five inevitably involves well happened past basis project might happen future would would happened question might happen happened determination might made basis rumor innuendo point questions nt come labeled simply predictive versus happened past suppose neither ask government move modification decree assume decision court said supermax federal level imposed court court well talked something imposed want know imposed first court order even mean saying forced effectively government well seems case would court rendered decisions hewitt sandin say seventh circuit please reconsider sounds though nt done probably think okay general petro get details think process due concerned preliminary question whether liberty interest know nt challenged existence sure lets hook case years ago sides apparently wanted statute existence conceded court appeals statute existed wanted us say presumptively existing statute said held since serious doubt whether statute properly enacted reach question first going speculate know hypothetical statute said think asking us sort thing know without even conceding government nt concede anyway united states nt asking us hold covered due process clause given enough nt nt like speculate hypothetical questions like really seems say liberty interest flies face reasoned opinions area especially sandin language almost almost right point note also conner confinement exceed similar totally discretionary confinement either duration degree restriction nt understand person liberty interest put maximum security facility presumably could put prisoners maximum security mean nt pull fingernails anything eighth amendment problem wanted could put prisoners maximum security right liberty interest nt well understand feel like something fool asked know justice scalia liberty interest would procedures enough secure kind work usually know usually ask answer real questions nt solitary confinement involved sandin nt say sandin solitary confinement enough create ms ms maynard class action nt prisoners maybe majority prisoners reality prior factual hearing exists nt disposition would court make case mean suppose think trialtype proceeding necessary fact given people class action rest happens case mister mr general petro one would like hear say question presented petition certiorari thank general petro ms ms maynard hear yes thank ms ms maynard mister mr lobel hear would tell us happened mister mr austin case mean get notice sort thing general case submitted mean person reads regulation would see says classify state show repetitive seriously disruptive behavior demonstrated chronic inability adjust evidenced repeated class two rule violations guess would like know give least vague idea behavior talking class two rule violations talking notice tell two things mean nt understand case amazed think detailed requiring far elements know inmate want know suppose think wrong need know tell wrong thing think need know committee warden decides reasons asking book want know basic reasons things ca nt work briefs quite honestly whether new policy gives new things two things nt already say would think basic information includes idea disruptive behavior idea class two violations convicted heard say get nt get sure fault want know get information hearing heard said get said nt care nt want know thinks sent prison roommate rat fink made bunch stories right needs know whether board considering come explain nt true nt evidence know point charge claim saying gets report example record report moved level one level five nt comparison entire prison population rather five versus four well view consider normal practice ohio system keep people solitary twentythree hours day well nt standard reference use dealing small number inmates large population nt frame reference telling whether liberty interest comparison large population ask may ask question procedure describing procedure reviewed district court evidence record district court describes exactly describing form form record take ms ms maynard start maybe could answer question tried ask end argument record report well describe us gets fortyeight hours notice notice going hearing else get get summary written report get statement reasons hearing starts gets fortyeight hours notice told going hearing fortyeight hours get fortyeight well two seems questions fact mean ultimately position may correct ca nt place lot store predictive versus nonpredictive judgment contrary argument say well almost cases convicted crime prison forth well undercuts seems basic argument trying make established line predictive nonpredictive judgment suppose would say even cases matter past effect procedures adequate would well say marginally greater four marginally greater one two certainly well point case inmate expect put solitary confinement twentythree twentythree half hours day period one two years without process extraordinarily onerous different general run incarceration practice thirty thirty days believe nt one year two years three years typically represented maybe maybe wrongly typically represented tend year two year periods fact tend extended periods time nt may may ask question realize predictive element nt think anyone disputes one points contention understand even new policy give inmate statement charge reason reclassification five correct notice give notice reason reclassification kind person gang member tell anything evidence reason know say reconsidered considered reclassification hit somebody head shown member gang reason well say opportunity actually tell reclassified proposal reclassify violated particular regulation particular conduct asking tell inmate initiates process please answer question point get point get general petro nt going ask tendentious question something nt want make mistake going back answer justice ginsburg question given described bare bones report beginning proceedings gets fortyeight hour notice example bare bones report say reconsidered reclassification believed gang leader get gang leader information worried evidence want know charge always get charge gang leader example told accused gang leader occurring well population respect adopted far lenient process population control unit understand comparable unit talking ohio respect general maximum security population housed conditions less onerous control unit okay
