mister mr horwich leave hypothetical may ask member legislative body considering would want happen situation kind frightening thought would want know kind testimony medical experts reasonable expected provide cases like ingestion multiple drugs possible cases many cases cases high percentage cases break probabilistically fifty made fifty percent likely ninety percent likely ten percent likely might want go road reasonable lot cases go experts case would make difference tell us realistically cases ingestion multiple drugs consequence death sorry really confused thought pointing causation factual causation proximate cause saying difference think gets folded proximate cause one case one case suggesting cases might proximate cause problem said justice kennedy case said nt charge jury element crime proximate causation ever said vast majority cases wo nt problem foreseeability element ways killing people people die know really hard time carolene basically admit proximate cause almost interchangeable almost always charged almost always element required results congress congress supposedly knew could written statute liable contributing cause death nt said says result death take mean least least butfor causality result mean butfor causality result refer refer common law mean apply common law rules congress adopts common law crime yes brings along soil goes crime right common law crime congress used english language results would take mean causes depends mean substantial opposing counsel says substantial means would independently sufficed mean cheer suspect mean found case right call substantial factor contributed outcome one grain heroin would would well nt agree stuff read point well substantial think substantial ten percent twenty percent five percent agree language position enough important factor rather would like know view opposing counsel contends courts commentators use substantial factor terminology mean substantial factor factor would sufficient imprecision poor devils go jail longer period otherwise know tough luck mister mr well mister mr horwich mean seems dispute court somebody taken five drugs one heroin experts get stand say heroin cause death experts say really ca nt say whether heroin caused death sense nt taken heroin would nt died say well say said well say nt heroin made likely died well much likely heroin make well heroin made fifty percent likely death resulted would sufficient well take mine think actually yes might died even without heroin substances might perfectly adequate cause death really ca nt tell heroin played even know even use language ca nt tell whether heroin contributed tell likelihood probability heroin led death well question words experts careful say tell absence heroin would nt died might died even without heroin experts said thing tell heroin made likely died bad sign using hypotheticals rather facts case know facts case expert gets stand says ca nt tell heroin responsible death tell absence heroin would nt died tell heroin give essentially probability heroin caused death saying enough even probability small fifty percent said contributed set drugs nt say contributed death idea whether contributed death able say five drugs probabilities likelihoods nt like probability language likelihood using heroin made likely would die ca nt say using heroin killed well much likely make would die fifty percent thirty percent question words heroin likely caused death cocaine marijuana sleeping pills ca nt really say heroin caused death likely caused death anything else took question maybe death one question relates beyond reasonable doubt instruction criminal cases mean idea test focuses way probabilities likelihoods go tell jury find beyond reasonable doubt likely caused death anything else find beyond reasonable doubt increased likelihood death fifty percent mean seems odd kind question jury consider exactly would asking jury consider statute statute says result death statute say criminalize drug physiological effects criminalizes drug results death ca nt say anything resulting death except except reference probabilities likelihoods mister mr horwich nt understand substantial factor means way using understand ms ms campbell said said substantial factor means independently sufficient saying substantial factor mean nt mean butfor cause something substantial factor death without able say butfor cause death substantial factor causing death assumes actually played role causing death ca nt say whether played role causing death creates problem sense nt death would occurred ca nt say point accept well accept first problem intent reason justice scalia pointed anyone sells heroin someone reckless least respect possibility death resulting think enough bring within intent problem also death fine still show cause unusual situation brown commission expresses upon model penal code nt model penal code express call brown commission concurrent causes right butfor concurrent cause concurrent cause situation two people striking mortal blow therefore either sufficient fact second nt sufficient first necessary condition right separate problem pointed nt know others sufficient know necessary condition brown five states tell situation fall within definition cause model penal code professor wechsler debating professor hall dean griswald throwing odd comment decided tell us view okay stand correct want beginning think probably least important situation word substantial better connotes idea important factor word contributing means picks kinds quite unimportant factors thinking anything say case want respond nt say one quote brief wanted judge say could say right proximate cause interested cause say long subject cause contributes substantially producing death wanted say nt say actually read thought well want say important factor rather saying unimportant factor seem nt know words really mean seems closer saying law want us say know actually worrying case took quite long time like three levels complexity concurrent sufficient condition necessary condition trying argue whether thing model penal code would nt even pick brown ought federal law united states professor wechsler reaction look going arise infrequently complicated talk going mix everybody start write worrying real problem start write area going get people mixed matter say hesitate go backwards vague open language substantive substantial versus contributing sort say substantial leave let lower courts figure nt confuse entire bar entire congress everything saying government position contributing factor substantial contributing factor happy result heroin dealer persuades first time user please try heroin wonderful three days later addict new addict new user buys heroin different dealer overdoses dies first dealer contribute substantial contributing cause heroin disappeared become addicted one little one little grain heroin discover body person going away whatever twenty years wanted incorporate statute friend understanding butfor cause word would use would better results well know want want word going readily understandable mister mr horwich could get back instruction proximate cause butfor cause get back reading proximate cause instruction got next instruction says find died result using heroin distributed defendant think little unfair suggest willing go concept cause proposing problem hypothetical sort thing way doctor could say three people beat guy one threw fatal punch situation experts could tell yes heroin alone would killed case ca nt tell heroin alone would killed ca nt put point would able tell case tell every case whether clear heroin caused death right statute say die taking drugs person gave drugs gave kind drug responsible says heroin result death result heroin give guy heroin drives away result using driving influence accident killed death result heroin case thank counsel ms ms campbell three minutes remaining
