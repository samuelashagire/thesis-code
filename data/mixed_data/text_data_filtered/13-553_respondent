could tell precisely contours rule advocating told justice kagan election nt essential analysis essential statute statute stipulates members must dentists appointed governor would take care governor appoint dentists would would involve problem essential must dentists breakdown dentists nondentists let add requirement dentists governor always chooses dentists powerful dentist lobby always going put dentists board exclusively think troubles position seems lead case state state board board inquiry federal courts whether members regulatory body really serving public interest whether captured special interest mean critical opinion state statute says must dentists nt governor always chose dentists wants dentists vote dentists powerful particular state prepared give really nt understand contours rule find troubling really attracted idea federal courts looking state agencies state regulatory entities determine whether really serving public interest serving private interest would happen north carolina courts decide tomorrow whitening practice dentistry old statute follow ftc ftc decision predicated proposition whitening teeth within old statute well know last week case north carolina court appeals held old motor vehicle statute required one brake light rather two brake lights nt seem interpretation statute cover whitening would completely question mister mr stewart problem answer least asked rule going announce case guide decisionmaking future courts mean say board way judge keenan say elected board appointed board different say one dozen sort limitations say articulate ruling supreme court walks line goes looks trajectory taking colleagues expressed concern trajectory involve us case case trying decide far far practicing lawyers thought agreed stipulation articulated state policy question must addition supervision conceded purposes argument articulated state policy nt state supreme court sets ethics rules legal profession including constitutes unauthorized practice law let assume state requirement members state supreme court lawyers talking virginia bar talking supreme court virginia going say supreme court virginia actively supervised lawyers really really going review board composed nonneurologists deciding de novo whether particular person admitted particular rule adopted nt want want neurologist decide exdentists longer practicing dentists lot dentist friends sympathetic profession dentistry going give pass okay okay really think financial interest individual members board going significantly affected individual member board goodness find hard believe well mean question follows members board refrain practice dentistry year serve saying nt know answer ftc ftc say know ftc ftc say long sentences hard interrupt nt agree first point nt see immense difference establishing standards profession excluding individual profession goodness obvious restriction competition preventing somebody competing nt see draw line well one thing say soandso ca nt practice another thing say tooth whitening part practice seems involve anticompetitive decisions promising serve faithful private counsel sworn agency promise execute duties accordance law would quite different happening suggesting critical case like addon feature sort question suppose know come ruling makes clear alldentists board okay state says okay board five dentists three nondentists feel maybe pursue think question exactly bothering another example thing think difficult case one hand absolutely understand cases understand law least think would pretty careful group wine merchants set prices decide sell true group railroads true group truckers true blah blah blah okay probably including dentists set pretty tough rules saying state better get supervise subject antitrust laws state art seems fine seemed thought different example neurologists brain surgeons state says would like group brain surgeons decide practice brain surgery state nt want group bureaucrats deciding would like brain surgeons decide course risks supervision guess kind supervision nt present rule go rule revision agency b throw anybody go court get court order c even letters would subject state aba aba track want see talk neurologists kind serious medical board nt want suddenly destroy temptation medical boards throughout country decide everything favor letting unqualified person lest sue antitrust law treble damages attorneys fees things followed coming would much appreciate comment practice said antitrust violation boycott guy nt get profession flunked exam antitrust lawyer says profession would offer competition eightytwo qualified people specialty state eightyone makes difference questions unfair bunch reasons silver v know hard make reasons nt want cut justice alito would like also think problem neurologists subject antitrust suit answer seems lie kind supervision advocating go ahead go back justice alito put mind consist want offthecuff idea probably particularly good give active supervision consists either board regulation court reviewing awareness state law subject also risks anticompetitive harms ready set aside fact risks outside state law wants seem likely eventuate could write standard pretty vaguely necessarily right standard whole thing turns supervision consists whether good enough repeat know like third time think probably government nt definite position consists want give deference expert board determination would normal well going neurology qualification determination made people state neurologists spells danger look take suppose write still problem back mind three eleven million americans going medical care agree one extreme words enunciated seem cover exactly extent every medical specialty articulated already concern wonder something little bit better say doctors active doctors decide qualifications doctors well going back justice alito question look board board private practitioner justice breyer hypothetical neurologist came said think important us standards get board say part triple damages attorneys fees ca nt even afford defend case get board going consequence rule advocate seems consequences decision favor professionals representative occupation would ever serve government board chance antitrust liability would view advance purposes antitrust laws mister mr chief justice may please court dental board designated private agency would paradigmatic case illustrating reasons active supervision required board members majority least required practicing dentists evident selfinterest manner dental profession regulated regulations might keep people competing dentists natural selfinterest reinforced method selection north carolina law provides members dental board selected governor public community dentists saying critical simply right way commission treated opinion commission nt suggest outcome would different method selection different mean essentially goldfarb goldfarb involved virginia bar designated state agency matter law court goldfarb supreme court virginia supreme court state like state legislature speaks state simply unavoidable exception general requirement practicing lawyers whatever marginal selfinterest might outweighed status supreme court bar supreme court justices would set judicial ethics rules saying goldfarb goldfarb dealt relationship virginia supreme court virginia bar said course virginia ethics rules promulgated virginia supreme court would authoritative state policy true dental board north carolina could also true neurology general medical board another state say regulation board promulgates matter north carolina law subject review rules review commission body disinterested state actors pass validity rules standard statute rules review commission determines regulation reasonably necessary implement statute least suggests review commission engaged something like de novo review reflect correct reading law rules basis state wanted board expert practitioners able promulgate rules rules reviewed deferentially within state agency question would arise deferential review sufficient constitute active supervision de novo yes patrick v question chevrontype review enough open question main point making rules review commission north carolina evidently nt believe anything amiss agency composed rules review commission agency composed nonexperts reviewing regulations promulgated expert body consistency governing statutes question exclusion individual member proceeding revoke license particular practitioner whether would qualify state action immunity unlikely adverse consequences competition whole therefore would likely subject antitrust concern sorry mister mr justice would say two things say three things maybe think first would say theory still applies selfinterest would present whether required dentists second thing would say harder case situation would least need look beyond statute books order determine whether people dentists would get least little closer guess third point going make aware board like amicus briefs sides say frequent practice states establish regulatory boards required law composed members profession regulated amicus briefs side says good efficient practice amicus briefs side say problem agree prevalent practice guess point going make frequent practice states requiring law regulatory boards staffed members profession appears instance state left governor decide appoint governor chose appoint practitioners mean part point case prepared give nt think strong case mean fact required dentists signals capacity certainly advocating court look internal subjective decisionmaking processes individual members members membership board people active participation dental profession economic interest court omni outdoor certainly made clear court supposed probing whether fact individual board member made decision based illicit criteria would still majority think commission used phrase like decisive coalition case sense majority treatment dentists board exacerbated six nine board members actually practicing dentists three members think board composed retired dentists people selected expertise current financial interest would legitimate way staffing guess previous answer add board members selected dispassionate state official could also circumstances board members financial interest selected might treated separate problem active participation problem board boards staffed active practitioners long adequately supervised mean different mean different things could qualify adequate supervision part turns nature question answered difficult question posed case ultimate contested question teeth whitening practice dentistry defined north carolina law question statutory interpretation north carolina statute speaks removing stains accretions human teeth arguments sides whether encompasses teeth whitening methods used today kind dispute capable definitively resolved might might point going make determination whether particular individual qualified practice neurology different sort question issue teeth whitening practice dentistry question one law court capable deciding might might give deference views particular administrative agency view would certainly make sense matter state administrative law give deference view selfinterested practitioners reasons legal question reasons reason think state action immunity nt apply mean depends first would would want look question alleviate financial interest guess order even potentially qualify satisfying active supervision requirement one supervisory member would power countermand orders issued members simply one designated supervisor nt authority hesitant take position behalf ftc ftc would turn part part would expectation person return private practice year sufficient maintain fundamentally private characteristic well guess part would say response hypotheticals legitimate questions seems us case furthest end spectrum case members board actually participated decision issue cease desist letters practicing dentists people required law practicing dentists appointed practicing dentists thing would say mean way read judge keenan concurrence majority opinion said least members selected practicing dentists state action immunity leave another day question whether outcome would different members selected government frankly court wanted say part opinion long actually required law practicing dentists state action immunity law nt require happens pattern gubernatorial appointment court says outcome would fact different case would prefer decision says going give boards blanket pass foresee hard questions end day guess two things two three things would say first think decisions whether particular individual practitioners licensed license license revoked fundamentally different type determination legal question teeth whitening generic type service practice dentistry within particular state law second thing although justice sotomayor certainly right court nt announce decisions good one case leave every question unresolved court also court also proceed incrementally nt feel disabled announcing right rule case simply foresee difficult cases arise future rule announcing wo nt clearly revolve involve anticompetitive decisions involve require state tap expertise basic decision prohibit unlicensed individuals removing stains accretions teeth made north carolina legislature back many decades ago obviously north carolina legislature expert body composed dentists presumably got input dental profession tapped relative expertise purposes making decision determination statutory structure established determination whether teeth whitening falls within one enumerated categories really establishing standards interpreting existing standards require interstitial discretionary decisionmaking point justice kagan alluding earlier want interstitial decisions made disinterested persons least made disinterested persons nt feel confident truly reflect policy choices state legislature north carolina mean make case clearest north carolina supreme court held authoritative construction state law mean would basically end could still potential arguments mode enforcement anticompetitive consequences went beyond basic prohibition intents purposes north carolina legislature specified nondentists lawfully perform teeth whitening policy choice would subject secondguessing ftc ftc federal antitrust court similarly north carolina supreme court said construe existing statute meaning determination also would nt subject review antitrust court lot ftc ftc specifically declined announce decision one way complaint counsel prosecuting case commission offered reasons believe teeth whitening covered provision basically two reasons first scientifically teeth whitening result removal stains accretions staining material remains enamel simply bleached discoloration less evident second type evidence complaint counsel offered back statute passed methods removing stains accretions would familiar legislature involved scraping chipping extent electronic instruments type procedure could safely done people lacked expertise agree say commission specifically declined announce decision one way correct reading north carolina law well conceded commission assumed arguendo clearly articulated state policy instance rather dental board composed dentists composed disinterested bureaucrats would hear dentists would make determination clear articulation requirement would satisfied clear articulation satisfied something phrased relatively high level generality mean thought consequence court decision would leery urging result see cases like goldfarb virginia bar instance held susceptible suit antitrust laws could invoke state action immunity ahead virginia supreme court nt effect inducing members bar en masse refrain bar association activities finish answer justice ginsburg even statute phrased relatively high level generality leaves interstitial questions unresolved still satisfy clear articulation body disinterested bureaucrats said interpret phrase removal stains accretions include teeth whitening clear articulation statute even though nt resolve every question would determination made body would require active supervision would good enough would satisfy prerequisites state action immunity court articulated could like make two two additional points first fair amount talk first part argument oath oath north carolina general statute eleven seven basically members board like like people designated state officials generally take oath support constitutions north carolina united states essentially loyal state north carolina essentially state law version oath new members court bar take take sworn done morning believe members know members bar swear support constitution united states believe also swear faithfully execute duties officers court members bar court private counsel take oath one imagines lose private character particular nobody construes oath promise private counsel place interests general public ahead interests clients everybody understands vigorous representation particular constituency may consistent nothing oath requires place interests public par interests dental community everything selection fact required dentists fact selected dentists reinforces sense expected treat dental community constituency last thing say lot debate areas like centers idea profession regulating neurologists regulating neurologists dentists regulating dentists lot board dentists regulation regulating dentists case case dentists regulating nondentists particular dentists telling dentists telling nondentists endeavors legally compete dentists concerns underlie sherman act unfair restrictions competition zenith case like one thank presumably also set judicial ethics rules sorry please well one members board appointed fulltime member board oneyear term called board state supervisor good enough one year one year practicing dentistry whatever way supervisor responsive justice breyer concern supervisor knows talking comes dentistry okay authority one year veto whatever board decides thank counsel mister mr mooppan four minutes remaining
