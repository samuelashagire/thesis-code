eighteen hundred private landowners excuse one thousand private landowners eighteen hundred plots land sorry state private inholdings ten percent total area dotted place tomorrow one thousand crosses could go nobody would know whether private land public land moreover sorry justice stevens government argued argued violation prior transfer statute remains government position although said justice scalia think position overtaken events question court transfer statute going go say chief justice addition fact private inholdings riddle preserve government perfectly happy put signs make clear plot question fact government vfw vfw nt think correct mister mr chief justice think preserve would put signs various historic cultural otherwise important well suspect great many identification signs

superintendent drove site virtually nobody could see war memorial way going one two directions cima road could put signs cima road said exactly going see know one hundred yards mile whatever think mister mr chief justice going put signs would still valid make completely clear said many many private holdings within preserve people could put whatever religious symbols wanted one simply would nt know whether private land land say addition preserve superintendent would like put sign essentially telling preserve users war memorial provenance correct justice sotomayor say kind sign maybe justice ginsburg mind smaller would go right war memorial order see think would easy put signs road make clear anybody area would know land small plaque small plaque correct correct said something superintendent would like think would consistent signage area nt believe ever came justice sotomayor talk merits brief court nt think ever came could reserve balance time mister mr chief justice thank

memorial possibly war memorial preserve war memorial choice nt see issue us look procedurally little boring seems pretty well established law read case called toledo scale bunch cases jurisdiction going name sure looked travelers indemnity et cetera seems make absolutely clear litigant others opportunity raise matter case done injunction stays issues previously raised could raised gone question left whether government complied injunction read injunction injunction says government enjoined permitting display latin cross period law takes effect follow violating injunction nt need nine proceedings see violating nt like injunction think statute changed circumstances need remedy go back district court say judge change injunction nt done therefore question us whether ninth circuit right saying carry statute effect violating injunction think one could say nt technical boring issue nt know heard issue nt see could reach issue case talking talking first talking first injunction first injunction says government may permit display covered permitting display compliance plaintiff said comply statute compliance turn vfw vfw uncover permitted displayed see issue us nt see issue us want get clear procedurally sorry take one second read modification injunction respondent asked said judge either hold transfer violates current injunction modify injunction district court said proposed transfer violates permanent injunction permanent injunction like third paragraph july twentyfourth order says permanently enjoined permitting display latin cross therefore rejected need modify held violates injunction written ninth circuit affirmed question case modifying question one think justice scalia taking good argument whether proposed statute violates july twentyfourth injunction case wrong thank well assume act going valid could come said important case congress taking action therefore hear standing argument avoid necessity legislative branch come could said would suppose guess nt agree dichotomy either action entirely separate would suppose could issues carry perhaps standing one issues completely new effect legislation could nt district court since nt passed standing different mean determined standing reflected final judgment think later aspects simply whether person embodied judgment think basis standing earlier questions whether visited enough planned visit enough get time expires would like spend couple minutes merits laughter wonder could focus particular question government sold simply one square foot whatever area base cross resting ground would argument well nt nt case well nt interference singling someone private property owner using property particular way religious way going putting signs people putting religious symbols nt done anything like nt say property owners maybe something know ramshackle shack want people know nt government property nt anything like hypothetical would religious property would special warning signs question nt want get rebuttal time briefly question whether signs nt valid required us case signs asking us consider whether statute valid thank counsel mister mr eliasberg thank counsel counsel
