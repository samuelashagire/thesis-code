state legislature articulates clearly expresses affirmatively wants municipalities share state antitrust immunity sufficient degree specificity necessary particular anticompetitive conduct state wants cover well well nt want take rebuttal time nt see consistent answer justice kagan grant discretionary authority nt think grant powers case would permit hospital authorities corporation set prices services competitive prices order serve needy nt inherent regulations tying network tying products tie products guess adds issues pricefixing mechanism tying mechanism expressed left mergers acquisitions point could define necessity use hearkening back justice kagan plenty cases say nt need find whether exemption necessary make program work nt make judgment state makes judgment exactly answer conceded whether discretion necessary make work authority say yes definition necessity counsel interrupt moment address question raised justice breyer alternative argument lots evidence authority little oversight hospitals move forward issue us question immunity happens operation hospital merger acquisition actual formation extent conclude state delegated immunity basis merger need look whether appropriate degree supervision decision mister mr horwich said reply brief hospital authorities law specifically authorized local hospital authorities acquire hospitals within geographic area clear articulation requirement would satisfied authorities law authorize acquisition hospitals nt say one two says facilities nt hospital laws law exactly said would satisfy clear articulation requirement cases slice fine state actor anticompetitive purposes others assume normal corporate charter contains provision authority acquire property right nt charter issued state right nt nt think enables corporations ignore sherman act mister mr horwich could give examples make sure understand basic position suppose statement said clearly hospital authorities power engage acquisitions hospitals normal actor would violate antitrust laws basically said hospital authorities discretion state nt know hospital authority might also might would subject immunity correct yes sheer grant authority authority completely discretionary state basically saying nt know going let hospital authority figure trying get state put table completely discretionary action state expressed preference state said hospital authority think conditions ground particular locality decide whether anticompetitive acquisition appropriate language language brief necessarily inherently compelled things really part governing test well next line give give hospital authority power acquire operate projects power form operate one networks hospitals physicians health care providers read certainly includes rather specific power acquiring hospital read something might see general motors charter language grant power want know want us mind reading statute provides regulation price regulation hospitals say doubt thought one way could think one hundred could prices different set free market doubt sets start go back justice scalia original question want us say even though statute immune grant immunity attack basis cost price regulation immune respect mergers okay unfortunately think fifty examples merger might anticompetitive yet would lead lower prices department justice might attack statute bothering seems want kind thing decided yes think know understanding question guess take given even though say true would find statute clearly prohibits application antitrust laws pricing decisions job authority start say okay decide might say even win mergers different trying get say want ask different one specific language read two think examples merger would anticompetitive doj doj ftc ftc rules yet probably would purposes statute lowering cost think null set nt think words mean form operate one major networks hospitals follow words acquire operate projects defined include hospitals words nt good enough looking section thirty well thirtyone seven seventyfive three falls within words acquire operate projects ca nt words two hospitals town say price shall see price higher thirtyeight cents whatever would please get together certain similar terms similar agreements similar prices nt want either higher would proceed would also electricity regulator state telephone local telephone regulator gas pipeline regulator thing said prices file tariffs tariffs reached go meet committee would also fall within antitrust laws well language awfully similar find public utility statutes set reasonable rates certain nobody higher reasonable rate mean establish rates charges services use facilities authority well follow chief justice question suppose shown many rural counties rural areas georgia much like one would change case thought purport thrust question well know georgia one fiftyeight counties something think probably many rural areas one two hospitals guess understand answer justice ginsburg saying would difference charter said authority may require acquire properties fulfill mission said authority may acquire properties promote mission think general saying may acquire properties nt implicitly say may acquire properties seems pretty thin well already told us state action purposes others fact examples might conclude nt mean nt seem categorically suggest prevail respect another one powers granted may completely wrong tell would doubt counties municipalities size going know five hospitals authority could acquire hospital yet still significant merger consequences face words law passed giving power acquire hospitals nt case would likely one hospital two acquisition another hospital would merger consequences one thank counsel mister mr waxman thank counsel case submitted
