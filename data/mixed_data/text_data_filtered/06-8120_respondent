policy alone justified exceptional sentence page fiftythree said sentencing court rely additional aggravating factors imposing exceptional sentence think well trial court said three standing alone sufficient court appeals said two challenged two going deal challenge two factors case think court take case coming coming washington courts courts essentially said two case well washington appellate court essentially could said petitioner right two aggravating factors could nt relied relying standing alone chose going interpret trial court relying one basis responding claim error think court take case coming basis could turn issue blakely retroactivity minutes addition points made blakely new rule would also submit blakely watershed rule bedrock rule essential fair trial rules bedrock approach fundamental sweeping importance gideon blakely nt kind importance three reasons first right counsel pervasively affects every aspect trial blakely affects procedure determining punishment defendants already found guilt beyond reasonable doubt elements crime second felony trial defendant denied counsel inherently unfair inherently unfair use preponderance standard find facts determine extent punishment fact constitution permits use preponderance standard find many facts much impact punishment facts covered blakely include facts trigger mandatory minimums facts judge relies sentence within broad statutory range even facts judge relies sentence standard range advisory guideline systems third counsel essential fair trial deprivation right never discounted harmless error court held recuenco blakely errors harmless reaching holding court expressly concluded blakely errors necessarily render criminal trial fundamentally unfair unreliable vehicle determining guilt innocence conclusion seems strongly suggest blakely bedrock rule essential fair trial court questions thank counsel mister mr fisher four minutes remaining may sure understand one thing saying time filed petition december twentyeight nineteen ninetyeight already second judgment already entered washington supreme court pursuant reversal second judgment maybe give little help finding number eighteen referred says substance sentencing basis jury verdict wo nt get get free pass nt say judge could therefore increase sentence seems additional findings justify result thought would miscarriage justice think pointed would get pass would sufficient justify consecutive sentences yeah make additional findings goes fact nineteen twenty additional findings nowhere says unnecessary either
