due process limits congress treat sentencing factor opposed element statute require confused thought said may give twentyfive years mister mr dumont well context case let take rivera situation congress said first circuit got wrong rape included serious bodily injuries read statute carjacking allegation rape took place disputed yet person could tried jury carjacking part judge decides whether rape occurred would way statute would work understand correctly would preponderance evidence ten years added rape judge indication congress knew drafting say robbery statute opposed carjacking one case robbery serious bodily injury would go jury would go judge say matter congress intended read brief say well way robbery statute written serious bodily injury would go jury right way carjacking statute would go judge indication congress seems nt make whole lot sense distinguish two question age statute saying maybe bank robbery statute passed today would like carjacking statute facts case magistrate judge told facing fifteen years little confused understand correctly one actually administered blow codefendant magistrate judge nt accurately notify defendant faced magistrate judge says fifteen years one reads pretty much like defacing property statute colleague suggested offense defacing property nothing else happens punished one year physical injury thirty years death life whether physical injury whether death taken away jury right jury trial exist problem serious get one year unless somebody dies case get life nt get jury trial whether anybody died would nt necessarily would depend sentencing authority decided left entirely judge might tack ten years would nt leave sentencing commission might tack ten years nt big difference congress prescribing must way congress taking chance somebody whether individual judge sentencing commission way nt difference element something nt element tell us world difference tell us congress go ahead world difference letting somebody else something requiring somebody else something latter lawmaking prescribing elements crime mean least open discussion prescribing elements crime leave judge control sentencing jury trial right opposed forty years ago mister mr dumont assume know crime ten year penalty ten years prison serious enough need jury trial assume says know burglary ten years define crime defacing religious building something like provide ten years twenty years another ten years sentencing factor put nt need jury maybe even twenty years disproportionate yet nt know point say becomes disproportionate increasing ten twenty disproportionate yet nt know twenty thirty sentencing factor would people cared much right trial jury would think unimportant one context jury determine deserve ten years long congress phrases sentencing factor nt care jury mean trying come interpretation jury guarantee makes sense nt make sense piling know top one year sentence twenty year sentence disproportion sentence piled initial sentence nt think mcmillan nt say preponderance enough facts case defendant attorney certainly notice going factor considered sentencing way might old type hearing mmhmm thanks thank mister mr dumont mister mr denvir three minutes remaining open question mean open question whether whether sentencing factor preponderance clear convincing beyond reasonable doubt court never decided right matter constitutional law matter guideline law matter statutes guideline matter ultimately notice mean notice nt problem defendant always gets notice either trial sentencing right call sentencing factor defendant gains one thing loses two gains right proved middle trial loses ability right proved jury beyond reasonable doubt think practicalities question becomes congress authority pick choose things wants make elements things wants make sentencing factors everybody seems think limit take nt clear idea phrase limit driving towards tell formulation must submitted jury criminal case use term elements adversary uses question parsing meaning term elements know element nt element congress never used term element maybe wrong maybe well constitutional right jury trial jury judge determines person bad man question whether bad man goes judge mean guess trying ask rationale jury trial guarantee square results asked reach yes commit throwing bucket paint wall would really eighth amendment issue may ask statute said may increase says judge makes finding third party suggests person may done statute maximum go mean nt even proof beyond reasonable preponderance suspicion would constitutional allow increase maximum would raise due process question judge sentencing says someone reports judge thinks person injured someone seriously maximum may increased twentyfive certain amount would permissible indeterminate system increases maximum may certain facts come attention ex parte submission something like think standard preponderance evidence mandated due process clause words require judge make findings nt require finding said suspicion enough know think think would raise due process difference suspicion preponderance raises concerns difference preponderance proof beyond reasonable doubt see point use indeterminate sentencing examples judge total discretion judge could act ex parte submissions purely suspicion saying permissible indeterminate sentencing regular system statutorily required increases still follow basic principle seems nt follow opponent made point opponent made point one things stake notice notice indictment need specify subject much longer penalty bodily injury example seems see three things issue fair notice issue important shall make decision person normally wants jury standard proof view none constitutionally mandated nt give notice claim caused serious bodily harm nt give notice assume defendant always knows government thinks happened maybe nt happen way government thought maybe nt fact serious bodily injury injured somebody else mean whole system give defendant notice charges decide defend saying committed crime therefore knows government going charge said
