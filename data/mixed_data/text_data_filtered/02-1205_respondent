statute nt matter whether existed nt adequate solution think nt answer fact nt selfevident language alone answer gave separate question policy congress apply four year rule doubt language allows nt compel answer would apply new statute going get congressional objective getting four year statute broad well nt nt support started intending apply four year period mean across board fell back fear violating reliance interests would say objective still get broadest possible application could could said counterargument said maybe hope comment reading four year statute rarely going applied simply nt many sort absolutely brandnew freestanding selfcontained causes action subjects tinkering time time yes argument way mean often major pieces legislation enacted form looks like amendment current statute think cellerkefauver act mean theory merger law would really viewed new statute totally new merger cases speak prior cellerkefauver come section seven applies assets sudden merger law well view would viewed kind trivial amendment created half antitrust law mean see kind problem think well reconcile saying new look act congress act congress called public law thirtytwo seventyeight whatever prior act congress nt cause action well mean arises new act congress seems pretty simple nt give oh asking question answer question saying course intended private right action apply mean let go history see whether think think different issue way thinking nt raise serious question nt believe nt intend raise private right action engrafting passed act congress kind cause action wrote new act think answer understand approach gives maximum effect new statutes limitation congress enacted evidence congress wanted maximum effect well except fact enacted statute one problems troubles borrowing state law lot experience cases look statute state law think old cause action patterson recognized would contract cause action arguably one us today tort action probably follow state tort law statute limitations half case contract statute limitations half case figure state law applies problem even referring back state law maybe coming two different results well section nineteen eightyone construed patterson clearly contract cause action nt think clearly contract claim much much trouble going future adopted theory know decide future whether new cause action arises whether attaches greater lesser degree preexisting statute easy test one thing nt simpler mister mr phillips problem congress sought cure sixteen fiftyeight amazing diversity across country borrowing states limits claim could two years one state three years another six another congress surely wanted cut disparity similarly situated people would right sue suggesting old way inherently complex figure would closest state limitation congress wanted get away complexity nt know introduced complex seems less right look look interpretation answer one mean nt know thinking congress passes new statute called new new new laughter special code title seventyeight new says total new federal cause action claim double damages anyone injured robbery committed gun says robbery shall defined defined title eighteen section three ninetyone gun new define see reproducing going take new new new right course well refers old one see get three elements cross reference words view done cross reference still new new new done physical placement old old old think may equal protection problem person says know sue within four years somebody else sue within two employee twentyfive got cause action later one reason difference statute enacted later mister mr phillips would different case instead enacting statute nineteen ninetyone simply amendment said addition coverage preexisting nineteen eightyone add additional brand new cause action allow recovery happens get job answer seems suggest statute substantive effect get one result one form type drafting different result different type drafting complications preexisted trying figure state law applies forth says regime still survives lot areas would survive take side seems seems extent changing regime bringing certainty law inherently confusing regime would nt problems exist system much happen make valid system take words making appropriate modification stick title seventyfive call new new new mean point going problem fifteen versus twentyfive would nt mean would apply twentyfive see fifteen would nt apply twentyfive right since language see discover small industry would subject four year statute larger firm would subject old statute exactly complaining interpretation wrong thank mister mr phillips mister mr newsom hear mister mr newsom reason congress grandfathered claims already existed mister mr phillips said expectations hook two years say nt exist right created right relief nt exist say fine tuning existing cause action plaintiff could nt recovered nineteen ninetyone amendment would agree mister mr phillips written different statute came exactly result said would redefine words simply said addition already may also recover happens job done still problems deciding whether particular like class two case whether come one section rather problem suppose suggestion would creating problem congress giving posing dilemma provide number one new statute statute limitations set forth specifically also true one unique cases four year rule help plaintiffs help defendants cases state statutes certain causes actually longer four years sometimes cutting sometimes expanding one question may statutes like made substantive amendment merely redefining term think kind kind unusual statute may unusual problem got thank mister mr newsom ms ms gorman four minutes remaining
