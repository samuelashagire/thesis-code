court never questioned judgment number two repeat said justice scalia one hundred years court faced many opportunities left standing legislation issue case first contribution limits expenditure limits came way tafthartley course austin specifically approved limits well selfstarting institution many litigants brought many cases nineteen oh seven onwards case court turns declined opportunity invalidate otherwise interfere legislation well think justice stevens right saying expenditure limits play case came effect nineteen fortyseven sixty years rather one hundred years fact even contribution limits thought include independent expenditures soon congress saw independent expenditures going congress closed perceived loophole fact one hundred years corporations made neither contributions expenditures save brief period time middle nineteen forty congress swiftly reacted passing tafthartley act reason congress enacted special rules second point wanted make third point

find bcra bcra course statute directly involved case substantial overdraft well would urge kind sweeping way reason nonprofit corporations covered make sure nonprofit corporations nt function conduits forprofit corporations well nt think statute substantially overbroad right took certain applications ca nt think see saying well could couple things could justice stevens suggested justice stevens suggested suggested chief justice roberts going go back yes exactly right suggesting justice stevens essentially stripping wellstone amendment yes know reasons might might appropriate wellstone amendment funny kind thing passed narrowly beyond passed really substantial support many people voted legislation end presumably poison pill strike wellstone amendment left snowejeffords amendment allows nonprofit organizations kind fund ads separate bank accounts pacs pacs separate bank accounts include individual expenditures well certainly narrower think better solution facial invalidation whole statute think court articulated austin course government briefs suggested austin articulate believe strongest compelling interest anticorruption interest court articulated austin essentially concern corporations using corporate form appropriate people money expressive purposes well couple points first thing say abandoned austin simply said addition people money interest would really call aggregation wealth interest would say concern corporate use people money talk shareholder protection talk distortion electoral process occurs corporations use shareholders money may may agree well think connected come rely austin extent anybody takes austin suggesting anything equalization speech market know way many people understand distortion rationale austin way court understands rely would say either quid pro quo interest corruption interest shareholder interest would say something related shareholder interest truth view austin view corporations use people money electioneer harm shareholders sort broader harm public comes distortion electioneering done corporations know think single shareholders present corruption problems many many closed corporations single shareholder corporations quite right justice scalia say comes single shareholders kind people money interests shareholder protection interests apply strongest justification anticorruption interest think experience half states important one hundred year old judgment congress expenditures would corrupt federal system think think justice scalia wrong fact corporate union money go overwhelmingly incumbents may single selfdenying thing congress ever done look look last election cycle look corporate pac pac money ask goes goes ten times incumbents challengers prior election cycle even obvious reason corporations play political process want winners want people produce outcomes know way get outcomes way get winners invest incumbents said double digits times invest challengers think rationale undoubtedly true many contexts simply case respect case well well extent justice kennedy talking goes halls congress course corporations lobby members congress way could legislation legislation designed anticorruption interest make sure lobbying persuasion coercion addition course corporations many opportunities speak outside halls congress lot suggestion corporations engage political process corporations different individuals respect know individual wealthiest person world us maybe us economic interests beliefs convictions likes dislikes corporations engage political process entirely different way makes much damaging well suggesting mister mr chief justice corporations actually fiduciary obligation shareholders increase value single purpose goal everything geared corporation selfinterest order maximize profits order maximize revenue order maximize value individuals complicated corporations engage political process set know blinders nt mean pejorative want corporations well sounds though corporation describing corporation kind case one assume members sign corporation ideological mission corporation fact ideological mission well extent talking single shareholder corporations guess would ask burden single shareholder make expenditures participate political person way person wants outside corporate forum single shareholders nt suffering burden everything could within corporate form outside corporate form probably nt get tax breaks would get inside corporate form sure anything else different yes yes exactly right justice breyer addition one hundred year old judgment congress believes necessary recently members congress others created gigantic record showing corruption appearance corruption record many times senators former senators talk

important value shareholders choice ability invest country assets also able choose country leaders much appreciate appreciate justice kennedy think cover point two explanation questions chief justice asked interests government suggesting motivated laws compelling enough court certainly invalidate laws think fair certainly bellotti accept would think know national right work interesting opinion national right work accepts unanimous court shareholder protection argument anticorruption argument respect section four fortyone b later cases court suggested national right work focused
