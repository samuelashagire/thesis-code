thank mister mr chief justice may please court would like open addressing two questions justice souter raised first rather technical one effect pond nuisance cause would refer honor petition writ certiorari page appendix b isds isds system based testimony record fact nitrates things wash pond wetland mechanism filters nitrates simply removal filling wetlands per se nt speak one way mr chief believe justice kennedy would consistent decisions either rhode island superior court rhode island supreme court indicated additional economically viable uses available refer building house well three categories information established referenced honor memorandum opposition established established superior court proposition least one house worth least two hundred thousand dollars built uncertainty additional upland many houses built honor well sorry yes correct correct uncertainty established used least one single family home intended refer established unripeness problems case development might permissible get back question lucas significant court addressed valuelessness issue found substantial value lucas seen pure valuelessness case would appear settle question also discussion lucas justice scalia called deprivation fraction would appear require complex analysis required lucas finding valuelessness court opposed finding courts value yes think well recent would go back instance earliest expression penn central case used term parcelasawhole parcelasawhole discussion emerged recently justice scalia concurring opinion suitum decision referred relevant property aggregation owners property subject regulation least correct honor always face takings cases problem whether regulation effected taking whether property interests arranged way create valuelessness portion think without knowing facts behind example like could fall either category think important distinction like focus moment ripeness issues rhode island supreme court raised first found obviously case unripe two grounds first ground application seventyfour unit subdivision us makes perfect sense rhode island courts unlike court petitioner presented seventyfour unit subdivision proposal claim value determining size taking likely responsive argument made court proposal even responsive would argue even asserting proposition rhode island ripeness law want rhode island people come apply use come make takings claim particular use applied use point case critical word honor question question wetland correct property look ripe takings determination looks value look remaining value somebody insist applying apartment buildings amusement parks everything world residential development told still value property never applied case value property part wetland absolutely part let start ocean start atlantic ocean come beach top beach atlantic avenue side atlantic avenue predecessor parcel parcel began prior owner edgemere realty nothing case sold lots along atlantic avenue would consistent pattern development photographs owned pondward side sold first layer development consistent development pattern area comes sgi sgi owns land behind pondward side make eleven sales five come back six net sales four sales houses standing point sgi sgi fails file proper papers secretary state office property transfers operation law mister mr palazzolo applies fill remaining wetlands really third generation remainder parcel evidence coming administrative proceedings way filing made value value testimony case comes case superior court think think examples like court saw del monte dunes suggest overbearing state regulators honor extent sort general rule prior regulation bar think cases neither del monte dunes macdonald court inquire order acquisition regulation occurred every case prior regulation subsequent acquisition think reason looking agency actually obstructing nuisance futility think separate question answer question may situation entire parcel put agency make sensible decision nutshell honor ripeness problem case nt exhaustion remedies type ripeness problem assert mister mr palazzolo left something undone procedurally case assert put heavily burdened property administrative process could inquiry value us seems recipe prospect manufacturing takings isolate portion property valuable buildable apply show regulators discuss regulators property perfectly well build put impossible case record findings courts valuable use perhaps good deal would argue would almost certainly never permitted fill residential subdivision purposes would would hard testimony honor worth seven thousand dollars acre amenity value existing uplands well think trying make narrower point honor ripeness purposes intending talking parcel brought forward regulators whole parcel make assessment value ca nt leave numerator denominator uncertain test taking value left property application challenged regulation know value ipso facto always going one hundred percent burden part parcel precisely point whole parcel violation underlies ripeness know nt well ripeness somewhat discretionary doctrine may facts become ripe court lucas find ripen case nt formal application made use case rhode island court presented difficult situation presented case record contained nothing value property administrative record nt determinable administrative record trial record correct let first sure would agree premise first somebody owns ten thousand acre ranch forbidden building wetland corner ranch isolate wetland variety corporate devices claim taking would say first taking entity interests looked entirely certainly justice think argument could become extravagant got point define parcels think ordinary definition come chain title property got long run mean case presents interesting situation upland ends getting sold mister mr palazzolo left nothing wetlands face question directly nt unripeness value determination think circumstance takings clause able look history parcel ca nt situation whittle way thing ca nt build claim taking nt mean guess trying say particular parcel defined within single owner heavily burdened portion parcel time gets whittled able look back point time arguably owner time challenged regulation went effect define parcel thusly yes argument would run land period yeah yeah argument look timing acquisition look owned look state law whether things transferable kind transfer saying never go back inhouse talking know would happened mrs mrs suitum died last minute would estate arguably would fair claim circumstances think best way argue penn central lucas case court nt quite get really honor since time immemorial disagree brother assertion right fill rhode island never one never cases searched alternative proposition yates versus milwaukee series rhode island decisions cases involve harbor line way law works court knows right fill state property subject state control regulation one way state lets know gives assent establishing harbor line establishes harbor line build always always always one point common law right wharf build wetlands neighbor rest world nt state state first day rhode island owned wetlands fee still day public trust doctrine alive well rhode island time know size property look looking takings claim look wetlands application dealt nt sound like today think poor little widow woman owns ca nt possibly develop deal puts market somebody comes along knows regulation says look regulation going applied reasonable manner going pay x amount property challenge mean matter well buyer takes expecting make penn central type takings challenge everything whittled lord fairfax mean virginia anyway nobody would able make takings claim extravagant proposition course property everything whittled supreme court rhode island rely sides atlantic avenue seaward side well think cases like williamson county leave states completely free exact whatever want might call procedural requirements zoning yes answered saying hypothesis entire section land developer fences ten acres turned ten acres saying use even ripe thank general whitehouse mister mr stewart hear relying compensation clause armstrong nt case construing compensation clause mister mr stewart supposing bought acre land tysons corner fifteen thousand dollars nineteen fiftynine appraised million dollars government comes says well look paid fifteen thousand ought take consideration deciding whether taken thank mister mr stewart mister mr burling seven minutes remaining nt problem mean probably would agree first proposition may simply isolate parcel one unusable portion define separate parcel call one hundred percent taking go home free extreme got limit parcel use defining value somebody know hundred square miles effect way ever proving taking even though lights taking might extensive portion problem define parcel way sure raised case mean getting way reference normal commercial usage area people example characteristically define apply subdivision regulations subdivision approval size land tend group one parcel apply approval nt look standard standard commercial usage know define reasonably define parcel agree let say example say well appropriate parcel wetland plus one acre government says wetland plus remaining ten thousand acres minus wetland perhaps neither acceptable perhaps would look usage area determine know range developable parcels assume government regulating maybe texas would ten thousand acres maybe manhattan would one acre nt look criterion usage determine reasonable basis defining parcel order make calculation well nt say want answer read part justice scalia cited earlier say portion site would approved single home site true nt say whether things might also approved right though saying reading one might thought talking established could used single home argument comes back fully argued well maybe could four homes maybe could done things never applied et cetera supposed could address curious different issue get trouble takings claim run land like hear say found difficult sets briefs pretty good arguments see horribles seem occur either way gas station land dumped one hand people going buying old claims wondered opinion would work say run land one recover investment back expectation say somebody goes buys cheap land already existing taking claims benefit could recover fairness paid land minus value land purposes want see mean suggestion want know decide issue case get hard issue opinion period right gas station old map around person nt check title perfectly nt know lo behold wakes discovers four hundred cubic yards dirt thrown property making unusable say oh three generations back map filed somewhere said maybe city would ability know talking seemed appealing going completely one hundred percent gas station know briefs nt want go long person sold gas station years ago time map somewhere city council showed highway went subject kind support years later third owner finds one day gas station dirt said time support wanted claim familiar take word could unfair things happen result absolute rule replied justice kennedy saying claim valid right takings claim valid takings claim run land matter goes ordinarily let ask question geography looking tab six uplands wetlands uplands ocean words would person house uplands view ocean something built wetlands think point state governmental agency obligation come forward say allow may ask opponent says taking occurred nineteen eightysix opinion state prevent wetlands filled legal obstacle filling think ended think never take case assumption likely permitted use property question build one residence upland area leaving eighteen wetlands area unimproved seems odd would get question lucas taking et cetera mister mr chief justice may please court court stated armstrong versus united states compensation clause designed bar government forcing people alone bear public burdens fairness justice borne public whole petitioner regulatory takings claim necessarily depends upon proposition unfairly singled bear disproportionate share burdens attendant provision public benefits prevention public harms view record entirely fails bear assertion correct certainly court lucas made clear even exercise eminent domain authority physical occupation land may taking burden imposed regulatory limitations land use practical effect direct appropriation think incorrect least view record case strongly supports assertion filling wetlands rare practice part rhode island true nt comparatively recently statutory permit requirements imposed prerequisite fill wetlands record nt suggest extensive filling wetlands occurred understanding even dry land area short distance water table therefore even construct house dry beach land need fill fill wetlands nt environmental consequences wetlands fill point like stress requirements imposed recently crmp crmp informally predecessors generally applicable limitations ways wetlands properties used secure reciprocity advantage landowners vicinity easy say one hand coastal resources management plan hurts mister mr palazzolo one sense limits use make wetlands portion property time fact prohibitions imposed neighbors well tends benefit mister mr palazzolo insofar tract also includes uplands area presumably prevention filling neighbors preserves quality environmental resources area notably winnapaug pond practical effect restrictions function sort density restriction nt think justice oconnor one reason think short answer case comes court think petitioner really given claim wetlands portion property constitutes separate parcel third question presented agree argument point raised oral argument third question presented cert petition right merely property retains value greater zero explication body petition third question presented made clear mister mr palazzolo claiming wetlands portion constitute separate parcel value zero rather basis takings claim came court cert petition parcel whole value two hundred thousand dollars value small comparison purported three million dollar million figure amount total deprivation economically beneficial use think even point nt weighed would strong arguments regarding single parcel bought together platted together state appraiser testified testimony credited trier fact presence wetland areas even could nt separately developed would enhance value home constructed uplands area sense house constructed twenty acre parcel going valuable house constructed twoacre plot open space feeling privacy seclusion think also important recognize original investment property something less thirteen thousand dollars say something less sgi sgi purchased larger parcel thirteen thousand dollars partly nineteen fiftynine partly nineteen sixtynine sold portions prices nt revealed record mister mr palazzolo predecessor sgi sgi put thirteen thousand dollars something worth two hundred thousand dollars hardly anything taken well point would make three million dollar million figure important realize exactly three million dollar million figure means petitioner appraiser arriving three million dollar million figure looked nearby tract presumably uplands said lot sold one hundred twenty five thousand dollars said lots could constructed wetlands could made comparable sold seventyfour one hundred twenty five thousand dollars would come figure little nine million dollars million deducted expenses thought would incurred actually fill came net three agree mister mr palazzolo could ever identify point time property worth three million dollars million would different case point making hypothetical land would actually valued one million dollars million real world today look methodology addressed mister mr palazzolo appraiser took starting point price paid comparable lot nineteen eightyeight obviously price paid environment wetlands development region subject substantial restrictions effect appraiser determining mister mr palazzolo could develop property hilt everybody else around remained subject extensive restrictions development property would dramatically appreciate value even assume appraiser correct hypothesis ca nt form basis takings claim mister mr palazzolo essentially asking benefit arises result imposition development restrictions neighbors without accepting development restrictions think least general position would person takes notice existing restriction land use ca nt show taking virtue application restriction sure understood think word unfair crucial could think said ordinarily person takes notice mean certainly person could challenge nature challenge unreasonable regulation lawful challenge reasonable forces bear disproportionate share burdens therefore entitled compensated nt think would mean purpose regulatory takings doctrine identify situations individual reference brief opposition mean might made big difference whether wanted take case make reference fact uncertainty much additional use could made well late position general whitehouse someone say section land square mile either square mile picks ten acre plot one edge applies zoning use claims denied claims denied economic use fact remaining everything square mile minus ten acres means taken consideration nt think cases support nt generally get law concurring opinions chief hypothetical sells except ten acre plot reapplies ten acre plot denied development taking silly result first case nt yet sold rest one square mile sells rest one square mile makes application gets result taking mean seems strange even made clear going allow fill anything unless public large benefits mean keep coming back would approve never approve fill oh would approve never approve fill keep coming back mean part wetland well property mean property new york know property adjacent know theories denominator taking cases theories fact urged brother case say test whether area remains taken isolation valuable use apply kind theory would nt matter whether applied portion denied permit swampland part wanted fill acknowledge feasible economic use part filled purpose think purpose purpose would enable feasible economic use making essential case determining taking must look whole parcel restrict ourself wetlands portion whose development forbidden okay mistook two questions need ripeness depends need find taking need find taking wetlands could nt used anything nt matter applied nothing wetlands think two connected know value property question property property wetlands know come back proposal developing rest land thought moment wetlands value seven thousand dollars acre oh determined trial parcel thought reasonable buy yeah case somewhat like lucas seems landowners got first left alone wetlands people got act wrong well principle governs whether remaining permissible uses regulated property economically viable well really think irrelevant justice breyer suggested cap assumes government nt reasonable ongoing basis think wrong taking assumption worth three million certainly proof nt proven hypothesis property one acre appraised million dollars admissibility comparablevalue testimony position question justice breyer asked regarding rights successive owners
