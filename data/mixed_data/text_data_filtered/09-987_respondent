nt nt difference saying may used purpose enforcement chapter provisions federal law one hand hand saying may used purpose federal proceeding enforcement one nine certainly could used federal proceeding employer would would used enforcement federal law would nt think federal law state law seem exactly point nt understand two provisions fit together everify used suppose employer first thing employer receive forms employee one nine process looks forms well reasonably seem authentic employer good faith defense provided one nine process federal law state law federal law state law employee employer either must may also use everification system employer gets back notice nonauthorization creates supposedly rebuttable presumption systems employee authorized work fit together complete defense used one nine process good faith whole everification process seems irrelevant federal law state law nt understand fit together well page one eightyfour one eightyfive appendix petition nt nt frustrate congressional intent federal law says one nine used purpose federal adjudication whether violation occurred nt frustrate law states raise defense depends forcing someone disclose something federal law protects mean vicious circle federal law says ca nt one nine ca nt use purpose federal adjudication creating defense says supply us something federal law otherwise protects disclosure nt answer point nt frustrate federal law federal law says one nine used purpose federal adjudication status employees think answer justice breyer earlier question fact relying one nine provide safe harbor everify system ca nt rely one nine forms statutes rely everify would nt easier justice scalia concern take solicitor general position adjudicating good faith intent differently way federal government granted nt waiting asapplied challenge means whether putting different requirements proving good faith let ask question directly arizona system permit employer rely nonsuspect documents one nine documents permitted employers rely arizona system says ca nt rely preempted ca nt rely one nine arizona system says one nine documents arizona system says ca nt hire someone nt approved everification system preempted answered anomaly arizona impose fine even modest amount revoke someone license business explain everify federal resource federal government said want voluntary arizona take federal resource federal government says voluntary except certain circumstances turn something mandatory nt get preemption arizona wants use federal resource fed makes available employer use voluntarily mandatorily arizona set rules use federal resource also explain one nine said fed fed home free documents social security driver license also require everify everify information modify one nine two perhaps congress never expected states would resort massive measures probably would nt law uniformly enforced vigorously enforced right nt nt notion sort thing nineteen eightysix maybe congress nt worried seemed unlikely anything like would occur make mandatory nt get safe harbor nt consequence lawsuit challenge old law sanction lose safe harbor sanction think case look forward cases one one various types licenses would asapplied challenges would resolved case really wasting time nt excuse conceding variation federal standards criminal civil liability automatically precluded mean read exception exception state licensing similar laws nt say long licensing similar laws go federal government done mean often allow states impose regulatory requirements go beyond regulatory requirements federal government imposed automatically considered preempted conceding arizona go whit beyond federal government says main main anomaly seemed federal act first point chamber made fairly careful balance group people arizona may look come mexico speak hispanic accent certain whether fact illegals legal think category congress passed statute gives employer much incentive verify discrimination dismiss illegal hiring absolutely balanced one thousand dollars fine one one thousand dollars fine arizona comes along says tell discriminate know happens nothing hire illegal immigrant business dead one thing reconcile intent prevent discrimination people appearance accent reconcile arizona law businessman every incentive law call close questions hiring person federal law every incentive look carefully one nine question one nine certain thought federal law employee employer nt certain employee says social security card driver license employer looks home free right federal law arizona law home free moreover may home free still could prosecuted right shows driver license arizona law shows driver license social security card worker employer looks employer prosecuted yes right thought reading creates kind presumption home free federal law home free home free look nt trying understand maybe enough time explain thought federal law requires e nine business whatever e review worried e review seemed require seemed twenty percent cases notice guy authorized nt record authorized work twenty percent wrong authorized work employer follows really going fire twenty percent people absolutely entitled work would like address points wish fail receive quote grant loan performancebased incentive end quote state law says nt would think answer justice scalia question yes penalty nt simply hortatory nt go jail lose grant loan performancebased incentive right looking specifically federal law says look driver license social security card one nine docs employer established affirmative defense violated law says cite twentyseven federal law arizona law reading maybe another place read says determining whether unauthorized alien court shall consider federal government determination creates rebuttable presumption means might rebutted okay see difference reason relevant first question employer prior law fifty fifty better verify discriminating know da da da hard look drivers license look home free social security card hire illegal immigrant thing da da da okay ways law employer look driver license social security home free employer turns hiring illegal immigrant american business finished happens discriminate law nothing original point made brought question difference standards want absolutely clear answer well statute read words rebuttable presumption might reading wrong words tell okay thank see main point check think maybe mistaken perhaps looking section still stuck enormous discrepancy penalty mean characterizing enormous seems like know even discrimination versus federal law even business lunch gone side nothing one savings clause word licensing everyone looks look legislative history look paragraph page thirtynine red brief seems paragraph says means says precisely says first thing says look found violated page suppose somebody found violated sanctions provision federal legislation found federal government state revoke license okay one thing second thing says nt want preempt fitness business laws state farm labor contracting laws forestry laws words thinking precise set licenses licensing thing next participant federal law conforming amendments conforming amendments apply departments government concerned maintaining state farm labor contractual laws grant go beyond text us get enlightenment going beyond text seems go follow house report says response said yes got broad licensing let deal part look explanation put words underlying justice ginsburg question would congress want taking mechanism congress said pilot program optional making mandatory seems almost classic example state something inconsistent federal requirement know interpret answer confirming implication justice breyer questions substantial difference federal state law point mean told know lawsuits home free driver license social security inspection federal law state law difference could nt quite sure meant judge schrader opinion court emphasized statute evaluated face said asapplied particular challenges might arise would work determined preempted would face would asapplied challenge come think home free state law affirmative
