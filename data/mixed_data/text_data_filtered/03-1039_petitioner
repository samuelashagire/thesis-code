well conclude error harmless error argument fall back well prosecutor said several times jury course arguments burden proof state preponderance beyond reasonable doubt judge says prosecutor arguments law instruct never says anything okay well normally would think trial judge would correct misstatement law counsel would normally think would nt nt clearly done mean jury reminded arguments counsel attempt correct appeared misstatement except heard much evidence nt unlikely jury thought could nt consider heard make chief justice fear statement twice boyde prosecutor never suggested background character evidence could considered must nt take boyde qualification case prosecutor indeed suggested information could taken consideration mitigating factor jury misunderstood judge instruction instruction mean picture given defense attorney says use mitigate prosecutor says legitimate mitigating evidence said several times judge said well could argue judge never instructed jury left prosecutors argue law jury jury make legal determination seems surely error could still say well even harmless nt think doubt judge tells attorneys argue law jury let jury decide law suppose suppose take view violation clearly established law court allow prosecutor repeatedly misstate law misinform jury law life death question without correcting misstatement without saying jury jury prosecutor argue law tell law judge nt meets standard violating clearly established law doubt prosecutor makes misstatement life death question judge obligation say jury wrong take instruction instruction suppose view case nt boyde cases strikes clearly wrong well getting question think justice oconnor raised minutes ago urging yes error harmless admonition sufficient court said something evidence everybody mean question prosecutor said nt evidence nt tell misstated law talking evidence issue neither side suggests question law governs controversy law jury must apply make life death decision said judge corrected read joint appendix could find correction another problem judge saying argument jury heard arguments sides decide nt jury decide law well would nt jury conclude nt logical conclusion gee judge us sit eight witnesses listen nt exclude part course must consider otherwise would nt exposed prosecutor end closing jury seem even grudgingly recognize evidence mitigating looking page seventysix joint appendix top page makes statement law simple says aggravating factors outweigh mitigating factors line well facts case showing violence et cetera aggravating side defendant really nothing except newborn christianity fact twentyeight years old final word jury prosecutor seems saying yes mitigating factors insubstantial twentyeight years old claim newborn christian honorable court adjourned monday next ten oclock well thought holding factor k claiming claiming something much k understand claiming difference boyde standalone kind case prosecutor deliberately argued argued law fact wrong continued even court interrupted argument court never gave instruction corrected erroneous statements law prosecutor made saying boyde situation well mitigating evidence boyde held could considered without k different kind evidence mean postcrime evidence nt see boyde holding broad obviously cover might would closer question nt prosecutor argument judge failure correct even even without elements would serious question whether boyde covered well even even even argument point taking response terms get reasonable likelihood yes let get specific said nt reasonable possibility get get facts nt reasonable possibility yes prosecutor stands twice says judge interrupts judge interrupts says legally consider evidence fall within k reasonable likelihood jury mistake precisely recall correct wrong thought judge said prosecutor statements evidence course evidence issue nt whether evidence statements law judge nt say anything whether correct incorrect statements law seems judge response objection totally beside point court nt give instruction contested point nt come say yes consider k never said k candid say think stretching things far stretch boyde held character evidence pre time crime considered reasonably factor certainly evidence individual crime committed naturally fall within k might thought aggravating circumstances entitled great weight mean nt know evaluated aggravating circumstances mean possible conclusion therefore nt follow fact raised question life without parole necessarily found necessarily considering mitigating evidence one possibility nt long penalty phase take nt sound thought conversion christianity made difference yes actually nt really issue think find easy harder issue whether person thought differently judge would objectively unreasonable least hard question question arguing hard mean would perhaps come different conclusion california supreme court question overturn objectively unreasonable hard thing well mean really wrong judge tangential question question reasonably likely nt occurred jury would considered evidence converted since occur know nt consider reasonably likely never considered question imagine reason justice ginsburg said sitting california supreme court saying well heard evidence two days day six witnesses eight witnesses technicians jury course considered imagine even though nt agree nt mean says exact language statute gravity crime could say yes later conversion extenuated gravity crime try think person thinking say well plausible plausible perhaps best plausible nt relevant happened twentyfour years ago sitting trying think jury would thinking state law quarter century old facts nt know think guess irrelevant time penry decided yes texas texas know ones yes one two transcript hearing well penalty phase mean one way trouble read whole thing footnote boyde seems draw distinction well take take case assumption trial court erred giving curative

factor k excuse still call factor k question well equal inference felt entitled weight given horrific nature crime show reasonable likelihood jury might come opposite conclusion well point recognize nearly clean hypothetical present say prosecutor law simplicity aggravating factors outweigh mitigating factors sentence death let line talks conversion parts argument indicated one interpretation mitigating special k say line weigh one well always say whether going really weigh tangential one way saying well really nt mitigating know lawyers mitigating sense relevant jury give weight chooses jurors say well know important saying well shorthand saying nt fall k think jury might interpreted see going see parallel problem penry jury jurors actually violate instructions escalate argument bit get point could help thought two steps thought question whether reasonable likelihood jury misled ask whether unreasonable state supreme court conclude reasonable likelihood correct wrong ca nt overturn habeas unless reasonable likelihood may ask may ask question goes sort beginning position whether prosecutor correctly stated law also concede deliberately concede prosecutorial misconduct really asking course statement went whether jury apt accept question whether prosecutor acted improperly ms ms cortina red brief maybe accurate say instruction evidence received part trial case except
