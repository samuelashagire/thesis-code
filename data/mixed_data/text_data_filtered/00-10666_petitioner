things like federal sentencing guidelines also effect increasing range penalty within certain limits lots factors guidelines judge would still decide argument apprendi would throw go jury may unconstitutional theory question theory apprendi imposes constitutional limits discretion judges given judges many sentencing factors going fall wayside well exactly kind thing presumably argument would go jury whether possessed firearm quantity drugs involved judge opportunity depart downward guideline guideline says gun supposed go nt understand argument purpose gun increase nt apprendi thing theory practical matter even suppose judge thought harris gotten five years says well evidence brandishing could go either way want give five years find wo nt find brandishing kind discretion prosecutor suppose could nt say anything judge judge discretion matter legislature rules say close question whether brandishing exists therefore find brandishing bring five year level right nt say even knew said judge said well tough question going going make mind close brandishing also said would given guy seven years matter apprendi without apprendi seven years think right nt true guidelines judge find something jury nt find standards different beyond reasonable doubt one case judge said well would think nt proved beyond reasonable doubt preponderance evidence therefore find purposes guideline calculation quite common nt downward anyway downward upward upward know agreed laughter surprised agrees would think would would say downward saves guidelines mean suppose judge could depart downward guidelines could depart upward mandatory minimum would nt okay agree long judge guidelines option departing downward would nt case would necessarily decide guidelines judge discretion suppose single fact requires certain sentence nt right definition judge discretion single fact requires certain sentence true judge judge discretion making factual findings say false even though thinks one one fact true discretion say true question judge discretion say even though know brandishing going say nt brandishing nt kind discretion suppose confront brandishing issue ca nt say tough question know going going face law requires decide whether brandishing nt wait would allow judge increase sentence basis judge belief brandishing well appropriate sentence within discretion accomplished rewrite guidelines say get five years brandishing consequence even jury finds brandishing element crime judge may indeed guidelines must add five years brandishing thinks preponderance evidence brandishing situation guidelines require give higher sentence higher sentence five years mandated guidelines say okay right saying level kind inchoate sentence comes factors could applied long long upward downward departure say apprendi nt cover oh see said upward downward saying charged offense charged specifically brandishing jury found brandished would acquitted would nt would nt lesser included offense everything statute except brandishing prosecution would entitled charge lesser included offense nt let answer answer justice kennedy question well mister mr ingram mister mr dreeben hear thank mister mr ingram case submitted go apprendi want focus little bit assuming lose argument want know hard dissented apprendi want know person living case understands imagine two statutes want know think apprendi applies second two statutes first statute says sentence ten years robbery gun discharged fifteen question apprendi applies second nt apprendi suppose take statute rewrite words follows maximum crime robbery fifteen unless gun discharged shall sentence ten second statute treated identically first understanding understanding bar trying get wording nt matter right case also like question like get understanding defense bar understand important part wants extended question trouble seeing seems practical matter likely happen prosecutor come primarily drug cases say fine go jury want trial fine say chicago fine say two kilos drugs get front jury argue client chicago case happened around one kilo impossible argue given kind problem defense bar everyone else anxious extend case yes still present law good claim whether one kilo two evidence dispute find guilty verdict come point go judge say judge want want go evidence much drug really ca nt time front jury court case take maybe reconsider saying saying honest decides brandishing issue okay well let rephrase justice breyer question slightly make point think underlies part question apprendi true false apprendi unmixed blessing defense bar well given apprendi course face problem looking apprendi original matter think unlikely imposes real disadvantages defendants well case justice breyer puts shows real difficulty apprendi suppose suppose judge says policy court jurisdiction counsel come defendant gun brandished gun going go upward want know case decided said know would given counsel client six months nt brandished gun brandished gun five years contend nt brandish gun nt apprendi control view apprendi stands proposition legislatures control judges sentencing process well think apprendi clearly binding decide applied problems case fact think statute little bit different jones nt agree structurally really nt see nt apply judges discretion part concern yes suppose remand prevail well guess would new new trial sentencing point suppose judge says know jury found brandishing displayed nt think brandishing instructions gun show even nt brandishing going seven years brandishing well quite surprised tried phrase question get around said judge accepts jury finding brandishing everybody agrees least gun going increase hypothetical answer justice scalia said judge could say think brandishing preponderance evidence surprised surprised pile onto justice scalia question worst worlds disadvantages referred first yet judge still go upward seems understand argument clear jones mean difference use brandish smaller difference degree difference penalties smaller differences couple years difference five seven example understand make argument nt see argument sort slam dunk case suppose judge
