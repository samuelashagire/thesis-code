thank ms ms millett case submitted way chance supposed fact individual says nt correct translation nt stone individuals said threw stones side bus something stop bus nt actually throw stones individuals might important well tape question lateintheday thing nt presented ninth circuit suggested respondent somehow board government interpretation statutory standard differs way recommended pursuant convention protocol bind nations generally language convention protocol looks say handbook somehow establishes egregious standard countries interpreted protocol convention know uhhuh yes yes question whether serious reasons considering particular offense qualifies serious nonpolitical question fact law think un un convention binding united states handbook incorporated protocol statute protocol selfexecuting need statute implements nt statute says take account degree persecution received home nt statute protocol nt either handbook sets balancing test inconsistency fact statute seems close protocol nt significant difference two question oh well well understand go understand respondent say well ca nt really talk mcmullen proportionality seriousness crime light political objectives nt also talk persecution take going tell us non sequitur say might think normally words statutes context suppose person idea going list every crime u u code put two lists serious serious well would nt kind situation say person let say minor drug offense might consider serious well nt make difference whether consider serious purpose statute whether seriousness called serious means person sent back country killed immediately compared sent back country rather different country serve one day imprisonment mean might think tell person going killed send back country nt think previous marijuana crime big deal tell well going send back country rather different country happen spend seven hours cell say well okay give mean make kind allfactors considered nonpolitical ms ms millet may clarify ask clarify one thing think justice breyer said list everything us us code serious serious understand correctly defining nonpolitical crime attorney general sync handbook dissonance comes tail end question balance risk persecution thought defining nonpolitical crime nt simply matter going us us code saying serious less serious attorney general rejects gross disproportionality test understand yes take ninth circuit getting second reason ms ms millett give attorney general interpretation deference think attorney general interpretation may wrong reason quite different reason respondent says specifically nt care handbook says care congress passed fair meaning statute frankly find quite incredible adopting interpretation takes country people commit crime even murder long political reason long disproportionate totally different reading political non mean never heard nonpolitical crime opposite political crime normal understanding political crime crime whose definition motivation criminal committing murder rather definition crime political crime law cuba journalists gone jail criticized government press law prohibits criticism government perhaps law prohibits even law prohibits treason committing crime independently criminal murder rape whatever fact political motive make difference whether want people country nt allow things done political motives country want admit immigrants philosophy well congress said nonpolitical crime perfectly reasonable interpretation political crime consists fact think normal one know well murdered somebody proportionate really sort necessary political goal admitting people bases lee harvey oswald succeeded killing president kennedy political crime well mean laughter backing looking act someone assassin disagreed president wanted way could political crime assassinate queen elizabeth take current quite likely laughter scenario weigh proportionate know could achieved end lesser means maybe assassinating somebody else laughter find extraordinary going go deciding whether admit people nt extraordinary nt interpret statute way right ms ms millett attorney general ever let say given favorable interpretation allegedly political crime political objective least acceptable political objective government united states rewarded enemies side example cold war attorney general looks let say political motivation political side equation attorney general simply count political political objectives acceptable government united states time somebody tries assassinate saddam hussein current disagreement fails wants come get refugee status would take position attorney general would take position possibly person admissible disagreement regime well want know possible view answer yes person would admissible given refugee status possibly mean like kennedy nt like hitler question saddam falls know laughter graph going suggest line inquiry takes us somewhat far afield issues case maybe nt must confront case issue whether political motivation crime bears political character opposed hand defining category crimes speech protest political must case seems soon agree certainly attorney general position question political whether nonpolitical soon got political ingredient incident involved described totally nonpolitical telling every case every crime involving burning couple buses would always nonpolitical let sure understand position motivation motivation required satisfy statutory element crime crime defined motivation particular person seeks withholding deportation motivation individual necessarily term motive used statutory definition crime right well whatever whatever term mens rea intent malice whatever term talking talking subjective intent defendant particular case okay ms ms millett let go back justice kennedy question frankly getting lost thought position attorney general even ninth circuit dealing nonpolitical crime question given nonpolitical status crime whatever reason think justice scalia suggested maybe wrong reason typing nonpolitical anyway thought attorney general position ninth circuit falls category still weigh persecution thought case already willing make seems difficult determination necessary political objective mean requires knowledge political situation country forth seems even harder factors right may ask please go ahead may ask question bia bia application least understood attorney general test bia bia stated rather conclusory way let say political character crime outweighed seriousness described great enough come attention warring contending parties guatemala sounds though saying whenever crime given political motivation effective getting attention political contenders gone far criminality definition point outweighs whatever political character might might sounds though put crudely nothing fails like success seems reasoning bia bia would appropriate even accept ninth circuit opinion send back circuit presumably sent back bia bia explain reasons concluding little better conclusory reasoning characterized successful enough necessarily fail statute would appropriate well thought mischaracterize board nt mean saying emphasizing violence rather merely criminal character done may ask one know want reserve time rebuttal saying crime grossly proportional political objectives test test thank ms ms millett ms ms wettstein hear true government position balancing test third ground ninth circuit decision seventeen suppose established crystal clear person sent back guatemala horribly tortured answer would still convention torture mean us think torture convention maybe laughter bothering ca nt quite get hands purports presented argument standard apply looking paragraph read ninth circuit may everybody agreed standard mcmullen standard really case whether bia bia board applied standard purported apply read record come conclusion sure ask question nt really case people disagreeing standards least political may serious word word serious may word political may grossly disproportional mean
