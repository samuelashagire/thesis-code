anyone sees blue lights behind know keep fleeing police going give eventually well garner garner case involving shooting guy back right thank mister mr jones mister mr savrin four minutes remaining question whether creating substantial risk question could jury find otherwise answer point well used signal lights reflexes good sure question whether creating substantial risk death serious bodily harm others question leaving assuming reflexes good knew use signal lights could jury fail find creating risk garner talking someone time deadly force used creating substantial risk death serious bodily harm others dealing reasonableness officer action depends whether summary judgment stage jury reasonably find fact creating moment substantial risk serious bodily harm death others question could jury find anything else moment scott came case difference make even relevant let assume scott knew entire situation eventuated eighteen mile excess speed act individual assume scott also knew point joined chase individual driving car ninety miles hour crossing yellow lines going red lights et cetera point nt legally relevant data whether harris creating risk death bodily harm others agree whether scott knew nt know whole scenario eventuated speeding situation irrelevant
