long reasonable keep saying papers look totality circumstances nt know means think keeping time chief stopped keeping past keeping past giving ticket annoying heck whether five minutes ten minutes fortyfive define de minimis circumstances would make difference holding somebody five minutes fortyfive needs passenger needs accomplish break go home search home okay well real fundamental question line drawing created fourth amendment entitlement search drugs using dogs whenever anybody stopped proposing really fourth amendment permit well circumstances nt nt keep cabin caballes done simultaneous writing ticket unlawful arbitrary fourth amendment arbitrary nature says ca nt search unless probable cause search way justice breyer said saying ca nt unreasonably prolong ca nt hold person measurable time would allow get dog yes resources police department ca nt keep bending fourth amendment resources law enforcement particularly stop incidental purpose stop purely help police get criminals yes fourth amendment becomes useless piece paper well said else else besides extraneous dog sniff nt relate traffic violation else could could police say taken time needed look traffic violation high crime neighborhood like keep driver bit longer interrogate things might going take going take eight minutes traffic stop taken care instead dog come police officer says questions want ask say told officer could least understood answer heartland routine traffic stops minute criteria half hour want know complain longer laughter many minutes three people car mean got pick minute nt pick minute sooner later decide cases pick minute need three people car stopped broken taillight suppose police department small state every every police cruiser canine make common know check license plate call see person prior convictions also always take dog around car routine part traffic stop including time dog sniff ah routine traffic stop jurisdiction takes two minutes unreasonable right big deal dog walks around car two minutes prolong little bit nt understand could get little clarification argument understand saying accepting idea nt dog sniff something extraneous mission stop correct ordinary incident wait getting yet want understand questions focused like stop mission stop entailed normal stop contesting dog sniff something entailed normal stop even though might occasions dog sniff attendant stop ms ms anders sorry please know think read caballes differently think agrees think caballes nt caballes definitely agrees dog sniff part traffic stop think caballes definitely place caballes definitely says even though dog sniff part mission traffic stop going allow dog sniff dog sniff nt extend traffic stop like know two officers reason detained moment longer dog sniff caballes basically says sure harm foul one right saying caballes gives extra leeway detain people even though longer ordinary traffic stop would take think right mean think reasonableness language caballes extra limitation court says says like nt think officer really slow took really long time traffic stop able get another officer dog sniff like additional limitation diligent reasonable way conduct traffic stop dog sniff ca nt come even though conducted time traffic stop occurred additional constraint kind extra leeway police officers things outside bounds traffic stop search theory caballes questions ca nt cases really ca nt detain somebody nt kind objective reasonable basis detention know might ten minutes might five minutes might two minutes without kind basis fourth amendment violation suppose ms ms anders hypothetical police pulls somebody starts process police officer says know like cigarette break cigarette probably takes long dog sniff took know smokes cigarette goes back work right would say unconstitutional prolongation stop okay would become unreasonable nt anything related mission stop true gave ticket said want stay take cigarette break true gave ticket either way guess saying kind think thing acknowledge dog sniff something extraneous stop obviously helpful police cigarette break extraneous stop rules apply police officer taken moratorium stop middle order conduct business really saying reason pull traffic stop gives us extra time start questioning law enforcementrelated things law enforcementrelated business never thought rule always thought objective basis know stop dissipated rule going lead ms ms anders something along lines like everybody decide thirty minutes forty minutes think say one point brief reasonable traffic stop see taillight violation forty minutes free time police officers investigate crimes want range decided kind reasonable traffic stop problem great idea nt say taking test stop know whatever normal prolonged time reasonably required complete mission happens giving temporary traffic ticket could say last longer necessary effectuate purpose stop original idea happens language two cases already said saying anything different nt think since case apparently lower courts said last longer reasonably necessary policeman said mean effect said according judge hey called dog stop something like cite two cases say tests affirm reverse guess qed qed goodbye say litigants hope happy hear say sound said sounds sounds think suspect nt want know time necessary effectuate purpose stop time reasonably required complete mission ca nt better traffic policemen experience stops comes unfortunately stoppee rather stopper yeah course middle call dog forth ca nt prolong beyond time reasonably necessary said several times think may agree agree prolonged reasonably necessary least found end case yeah right lot problems lot problems rule based reasonableness course difficult problems said twice stop course anomalies respect course badfaith exercises course confusion inevitable situation ca nt anything suggest would help us show could something well may asking could say better language two cases mean denying problem said might decide beforehand kinds excuses know people every day week make reasons go want better rule one laid two cases nt think mean know get arguments reasonably necessary prolonged beyond time reasonably necessary difficult sometimes decide reasonably necessary okay thought position tried let state clearly think unlawful dog sniff dog sniff unreasonably prolongs stop okay write government write words opinion ah well ticketwriting nothing else policeman says hey point unreasonably prolonged stop sniff takes place afterwards well wait see see problem said well ca nt prolong stop traffic stop reasonably know take time reasonably required complete mission says complete mission intermission prolongation reasonable complete mission complete mission mission completed language opinion complete complete goodbye point becomes violation fourth amendment well see another aspect seeing way justice kagan described one virtue may think work administrative tell police department say well traffic stops use dogs sniff yeah remember traffic stop done finished way nt yet still well may get trouble unreasonably prolonged stop get sniff seems pretty easy explain fairly brightline soon get know leaving totally open check really much one putting get response saying two parts part one traffic stoppers use dog sniff stop stop period unless cause something stop part two ca nt prolong reason within reasonable time okay ca nt unreasonably prolong get dog see tell two things told two things got heads goodbye dog better careful unreasonably prolong understand protecting fourth amendment protects also think giving enough leeway conduct traffic stop think take said take answer say answer right bad effect rule virtue know twopart rule said virtue like many cases nt much say say willing run might purposely change sequence might true somebody might nt know answer could nt anything violation fourth amendment two minutes right laughter mean reason nt understand nt understand talking prolonging stop talking amount time needed traffic stop allowed prolong sometime sniff part time stop prolonging including wrapping stop say said several times phrase incremental sense less right mean actual traffic stop five minutes would nt say fifteen minute dog sniff incremental nt dog sniff less traffic stop almost always case dog sniff going take longer traffic stop mean would assume officer says license registration goes back checks comes back gives ticket dog sniff something else altogether assuming dog got get know walk around car really incremental sure hardly ever going reasonable dog happens guess thank ms ms anders mister mr oconnor six minutes left
