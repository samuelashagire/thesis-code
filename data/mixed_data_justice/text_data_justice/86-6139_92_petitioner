mister mr chief justice may please court question case presents whether clara watson test employer subjective employment practices disparate impact theory ask court reverse decision fifth circuit like discuss pertinent facts discuss five main points reasons asking court reverse case reasons summary griggs v furthermore eeoc eeoc guidelines applied disparate impact subjective practices since least nineteen seventy bright line objective subjective practices respondent would court adopt lastly adoption exception would urge employers least foster employers use subjective practices clara watson nine years experience cashier montgomery wards applied nineteen seventythree fort worth national bank teller applied actually several times hired hired hired teller proof operator bank time four black employees none positions visible public proof operators two proof mean printing employees basement cafeteria employee porter three years job made teller bank seven years job nineteen eighty first applied position supervisory position actually february eighty two supervisory positions available one supervisor lobby tellers supervisory motor bank tellers applied case refused job white male one instance white female another instance selected one year later two positions became available sought positions result white female selected lobby supervisor white male motor bank supervisor nineteen eightyfour even long nineteen eightyone refusal still black directors officers supervisors fort worth bank trust despite fact bank within miles two main areas concentration black population fort worth city twentytwo percent black population bank system hiring assigning persons jobs within bank one relied decisions supervisors department supervisors little interference upper management supervisors course white compensation system bank used series used evaluations supervisory personnel line personnel evaluations filled supervisors reviewed salary review committee salary review committee rarely changed affected decision supervisors district court court appeals found limited group white department heads made virtually hiring promotion decisions well evaluations used compute compensation upper management routinely approved decisions clara watson trial based stipulated data base presented comprehensive statistical study showed area hiring blacks hired rate three point five percent whites hired rate fourteen point eight percent almost four times greater figure disputed somewhat bank claimed hired people used applications persons hired disputed said hire people whose applications file two weeks trial also analyzed although able show really nt true supervisors making hiring decisions also making promotion decisions correct although hiring case actually remanded district court still pending correct justice oconnor think correct justice oconnor could used either way think court footnote teamsters says matter proof may applied either theory yes believe probably see apply statistical evidence disparate treatment theory pattern practice theory level proof greater court said exactly may interpreting well think sense least castenada v words two three standard deviations either point oh five point oh one statistical significance eighty percent rule would nt come level think would difference terms statistics fact statistics basically statistic significant think difference statistically thing fifth circuit held pattern practice case held class action refuse majority least refuse review disparate treatment pattern practice theory certainly cases believe judge goldberg cites dissent courts held statistics sufficient show disparate treatment believe simply said disbanded class upheld district court feeling extent really nt analyzed course would allow us analyze disparate impact also well course attempted district court prove pointing direction nt think would nt know would done anything different statistical evidence oh okay think disparate impact proof mean think present maybe understanding question justice white oh well think would employer come forward justify business necessity practices nt attempt prove business necessity validation processes would nt prove intent correct case present statistical case statistical expert nt believe prove intent think disparate impact case totally devoid intent could infer intent correct well think proof used ways think disparate impact probably hones group discrimination whereas know disagreement lot language disparate pattern practice cases talks pervasive invasive system discrimination forth intent interpret mean got basically show statistical evidence intent every stage process whereas think disparate impact simply show overall result disproportionate employer must come justify correct could rebut case trying show impact words could come try right either validating procedures set eeo eeo guidelines simply showing necessary efficient operation business right griggs honor griggs says effect impact must come justify practices unable justify practices liable continue practice liable despite impact justice stevens think several ways think courts addressed first validate eeoc eeoc guidelines course cited talked brief apa apa shows contrary argued respondent subjective procedures validated legitimate ways validate type criteria way think one problem facts case subjective nt know whether subjective process used really criteria supervisors supposed make decisions think system using think kind far general subjective hiring practice decision may promotion practice whatever think instance practice kind gutlevel system want well think think could also validate words could simply take instance one way could validate system would simply take upper management say okay give us series fact situations would want supervisor supervisors would handle routine things like social security check nt get credited things like instance attempted forgery give us situations tell us successful supervisor would deal way rate things terms knowledge job knowledge bank procedures knowledge maybe law instances speed resolve sorts things simply take two groups group validate validate words go process take test people successful people supervisors test applicants succeed find statistical difference side selected words find fact selected properly could continue gutlevel system words applies made mistakes going either find alternative process put criteria case would would nt well nt see disparate impact could racial animus nt imply intent lack intent first first honor think thing got realize able show impact first think smaller employers going difficult show impact simply number decisions would sufficient show statistically impact assuming could ways validate would way could think first transportability provisions guidelines things say instance bank teller job much different bank teller job anywhere else take studies already done disparate impact well nt depend intent guidelines required looking practices aware practices provisions selfhelp provisions guidelines employer encouraged try eliminate racial bias racial effects employment practices cited cases reply brief courts simply held different sorts things one comes mind zahorik v well think think true think however think narrow subjective things nt think fine line subjective objective instance definition test would objective essay test could subjective token things like personal appearance rating form used termed professionallydeveloped form simply nt use promotions objectively determined criteria set case addressed court addressed albemarle criteria set specific really narrows subjectivity considerably think attempts case law simply attempts try get narrower objective standards held justified business necessity thing regard factor respondent raises cost studies certainly evidence record studies would costly evidence nt attempt produce likewise well think body case law helpful however nt think estimates costs accurate think four cites none specific one opm opm study believe says entirely unreliable data costs would great instance one simply hired expert simply examine procedure validate content type studies simply decide certain things interview really relevant looked relevant factors applicable job requirements design application interview form goes behaviors terribly costly one type studies costs incurred impact adverse impact shown studies performed statistical studies showed instance assignment promotion blacks instance average fourteen months particular pay grade opposed sixteen months whites blacks averaged point one eight pay grades increase pay grade per year opposed point five three per year order test things like education tenure job experience job study included multiple regression showed fouryear period time blacks one point two two one point three eight pay grades behind comparablysituated whites correct nt believe justice stevens well understand think court said connecticut v taking effect group member group inferring injured establish liability agree class action nt believe unless came applied within one eighty days fulfilled agreements would eligible relief think case saying statistical proof would put case well class action could certainly come show members class well nt think proof necessarily says would prevail could nt get one job simply says well showing decisionmaking based impermissible racial component statistics saying saying everyone correct would nt mean every applicant would entitled job think right think applies class actions mean court decide whether person actually injured usually sometimes percentage allocation resources see mean like three four people complaining well shown disparate impact greatly favoring one group another hiring practices question individual group would prevail well one okay one person could get job let assume case court simply matter damages see would think yeah think would cause action nt think would relief saying nt mean would total relief might let say back wage award would determined fact one would gotten job let say disadvantaged one year worth half wages two people equally disadvantaged process would way commonly done class actions would simply split back wage award well think would problem intentional discrimination mean would nt specific impact analysis would thing disparate treatment analysis could show thing statistically know problem relief dealt class actions individual contexts usually way done class context nt think would anything know relative matter proof talking inference discrimination liability words damage situation would another portion see terms injunctive relief might difficult one position two people filed claim happen outside class action limited number applicants determined eligible said positions nt think particular particular method proof like time reserve time rebuttal thank
