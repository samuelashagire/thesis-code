natural resources indian tribes six seven documents submitted klamath tribes department interior government request seventh document prepared doi doi official provided attorneys klamath correct documents relate united states representation tribes interests pending general oregon stream adjudication well bureau reclamation management klamath reclamation project period adjudication remains pending time documents submitted department interior bureau reclamation specifically attempting prepare longterm operations plan klamath project abandoned long draft longterm plan yet issued still preparation still ongoing yearbyyear basis bureau reclamation bor bor manages klamath project based water availability course year idea behind longterm operations plan sometimes known klamath project operations plan kpop kpop colloquially devise methodology whereby department would decide advance water would distributed wet dry years whereas current practice beginning season assess likely availability water make determination year preparation kpop kpop sense interacts united states representation tribes oregon general stream adjudication state oregon making final permanent determination water rights order priority connection adjudication united states filed claims behalf tribes behalf project well behalf federal interests technically acting attorney tribes attorneys united states acts trustee filed claims oregon adjudication united states filed claims behalf tribes regard virtually entirety united states submission tribes filed document simply says accept incorporate reference claims united states respect small fraction case tribes filed claim differs marginally united states behalf think nearly one hundred percent alignment interests oregon correct correct united states also filed claims behalf project behalf federal interests instance wildlife refuge area united states think would certainly say extent submissions submitted extent documents submitted united states capacity trustee regard preparation united states claims tribes behalf would privileged confidential nineteen seventysix legislative proposal would created new foia foia exemption documents possession government agency pertaining exercise trust responsibilities bill never acted bill would accomplished exemption foia foia significantly broader exemption asking applicability exemption would turned whether documents came tribes initially perhaps important would nt turned whether particular documents would privileged discovery civil litigation focus court appeals concern perhaps turn page two brief sets forth language exemption five freedom information act exemption five states requirement compelled disclosure apply matters quote interagency intraagency memorandums letters would available law party agency litigation agency certainly nt fit within common conception interagency intraagency memorandum would courts appeals past thirty years devised methodology determining documents created persons outside government may nevertheless regarded sufficiently internal pragmatic point view qualify exemption think come conclusion documents submitted outside persons play role agency deliberations similar role staff memorandum would play nt referred consultative privilege certainly said used outside consultants example types really two different categories cases courts appeals one suggest situations person consulted preexisting expertise particular institutional perspective matter issue think fair say basis arrangement person serving effect temporary employee performing role employee would perform cases would say document needs submitted government capacity trustee example fish wildlife service making determination whether particular species listed threatened endangered endangered species act possible outcome listing decision might practical effect way tribal land used oh statute refers interagency intraagency memorandums courts appeals determining properly regarded internal focused existence special relationship outside person government official many instances outside person say one fulfills role agency employee tribe agency covered natural reading language think sense submissions properly characterized interagency federal government actively solicits advice assistance identifies person advice sought constructs decision constructs consultative process way reasonably designed government interests resulting document said internal sense circle begins ends government well respect existing court appeals case law certainly consultant temporary employee paradigmatic example dc dc circuit also applied approach cases ryan public citizen members senate former president advising archivist regarding proper disposition records created term office idea person outside government stepping shoes agency employee adopting employee perspective consulted precisely would distinct perspective proper manner accomplishing government objectives really united states act trustee water users association think trust relationship thing brings case within larger principle made claims behalf water association made claims behalf project association certainly aspects case users agreement think understand view evenhanded essential explain several component agencies within department interior two particularly important bureau indian affairs bureau reclamation tribes water users corresponded bureau reclamation bor bor bor bor received foia foia request tribes users association asking documents others submitted better worse bor bor turned everything bor bor absolutely evenhanded divulging tribal communications water users association communications may theory bor bor quite forthcoming disuniformity respect bor bor bia bia different story bia bia set special responsibility exercising government trust responsibilities indian tribes essentially corresponds indian tribes would unusual water users correspond bia bia bia bia subagency within department interior refused disclose documents one exception seven one adjudicationrelated documents addressed regional solicitor department interior primarily concerned documents submitted subagency within doi doi whose particular sphere duty expertise exercise trust responsibilities tribes court nevada v mean guess two three responses first correct bia bia independent agency subagency doi doi therefore ultimately subject doi doi control time government attempting deal pragmatic fashion sort combination responsibilities private party would ever given things would certainly cleaner point view doi doi could either say treat tribes exactly like treat everyone else could say treat tribes exactly private trustee would treat beneficiary namely show duty undivided loyalty clear think first principles court decision nevada v must one hand fulfill trust responsibilities hand responsibilities would considered conflicting imposed private person giving bia bia primary responsibility carrying department trust mission pragmatic response admittedly messy situation thing would say nt contend tribes analogous consultant sense stepping shoes agency employee agency employee would otherwise contrary think input tribes essential department carry trust responsibilities precisely tribes expertise perspective agency employee would well certainly well would say better worse bor bor favor tribes visavis water users equally responsive foia foia requests whatever gets tribes whatever tribes submit capacity trustee yes position would tribes approach bor bor say order fulfill united states duties trustee bor bor must take following management steps mean think obviously one arguments advanced favor legislation proposed nineteen seventysix legislation would clarify ambiguity would make unnecessary resolve difficult questions concerning application existing foia foia exemptions think court long taken position foia foia implemented practical way implemented way nt interfere government performance substantive mean certainly able persuade court threshold language satisfied documents properly regarded interagency intraagency memorandums letters would still persuade presumably court appeals remand documents would privileged past mean respect think court general methodology construe threshold language various exemptions way would protect values body exemption intended protect court said shorthand formulation admittedly exemption five protects documents documents would privileged civil discovery mean point work supposed done inquiry whether actually applicable privilege maybe threshold language screen things would privileged discovery indication either legislative history court decisions threshold language supposed screen lot take another example think also worth emphasizing one alternative think clearly table give threshold language absolutely rigid literal interpretation say nothing mean think mean think best analogy existing case law senators ryan former president public citizen people literally part foia foia agency consulted expected perform exactly role agency employee rather consulted believed distinct institutional perspective mean certainly archivist ultimately going making determination whether particular documents would made public private individuals public nt know progressed quite point certainly point scheme private parties would like much information possible former president records order whatever type research wanted former president consulted distinct perspective well think certainly congress years revisited amended foia foia various respects mean think think asking stretch united states capacity trustee particular bureau indian affairs owes duty loyalty tribes certainly federal policy twentieth century exercise trusteeship way promote values tribal selfdetermination united states trustee would agree tribes potential financial interest outcome decision various decisionmaking processes unlike interests recognized past united states supposed act trustee one central duties trustee virtually every context preserve duty confidentiality beneficiary would strange say tribe status beneficiary tribe interest trust corpus thing causes submissions lose confidentiality might otherwise mean certainly litigation particular needs individual requestor would relevant way would relevant foia foia think question premise question correct two different respects first fact view interagency documents nt automatically mean would even satisfy second part foia foia test second even satisfied second part foia foia test sense would routinely discoverable would nt eliminate possibility could discovered litigant particular need may like reserve remainder time like address question role government allocating scarce benefit particularly regard oregon general stream adjudication think court certainly aware way priority system water rights works senior water user gets whatever rights entitled water remaining next senior forth line position united states oregon adjudication position upheld ninth circuit adair tribes priority date earlier klamath project questions remaining quantification right united states presents claims behalf tribe united states believed tribes entitled certain amount water nevertheless asserted claims lesser amount order left project would breaching fiduciary duty tribes think ultimate question whether government solicited case whether government solicited input person technically outside four walls government based distinct perspective particularly useful government analogy sort relationship government water users exists government tribe certainly arguing trust relationship would say one example broader principle another analogy would representation current former federal employees bivens suits federal employee obviously personal stake outcome litigation attorneyclient privilege would kick threshold language interagency intraagency satisfied certainly respect former employees think necessary implication opponents test matter privileged communications would nevertheless disclosable foia foia could characterized interagency intraagency documents thank honor
