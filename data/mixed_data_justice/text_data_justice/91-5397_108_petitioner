chief justice would like reserve minutes rebuttal thank first point like make regarding argument double jeopardy contention state kansas acting law federal government state kansas acting law sort arm united states government contention always united states government one sovereign state kansas another sovereign therefore indian person could conceivably left wide open double prosecution federal government state courts secondly regarding legislative history act would urge court give full credence congressman lambertson said letter state kansas get full jurisdiction small offenses expression congress state kansas jurisdiction concurrent jurisdiction major crimes certainly congressman lambertson would put letter would taken another five six words say state concurrent jurisdiction major crimes taking consideration fact court held past one hundred plus years jurisdiction federal court major crimes exclusive technically law away exclusivity federal courts however reality laws congress nineteen fiftythree process passing public law two eighty specific granting states given criminal jurisdiction major crimes act general crimes act assimilative crimes act would modified accordingly
