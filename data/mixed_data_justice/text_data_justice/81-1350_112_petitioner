mister mr chief justice may please court since adoption fourth amendment customs officers authorized federal statute conduct suspicionless boardings vessels purpose checking documents issue case whether boardings inland waters constitute unreasonable searches seizures facts case may briefly summarized eleven thirty morning march nineteen eighty patrolling customs officer spotted forty foot sailboat equipped diesel engine anchored eighteen miles inland calcasieu river ship channel waterway connecting gulf mexico customs port entry lake charles louisiana officer board boat never seen sailboat waterway traveled large commercial vessels stern sailboat name vessel henry morgan ii ii hailing port basilea turns latin translation basel switzerland although officer recognize name basilea correctly believed denoted foreign port time large freighter heading ship channel created huge wake caused sailboat rock violently back forth appeared capsize fact one point sailboat mast actually touched water keel emerged water customs officer called respondent hamparian person visible deck asked right hamparian merely shrugged shoulders suggested officer unable speak english officer decided board vessel purpose checking documents examining documents detected odor burning marijuana also saw open hatch burlapwrapped bales believed marijuana respondents arrested boat searched fiftyeight hundred pounds marijuana street value seven million dollars million seized respondents convicted drug offenses convictions reversed court appeals ground reasonable suspicion criminal activity therefore officer prohibited boarding vessel inland waters purpose checking documents facts mind bears emphasis authority issue case authority board vessel check documents authority search portion craft also bears emphasis henry morgan ii ii small american boat inland lake seagoing foreign vessel ship channel connecting open sea customs port entry located relatively short distance open sea position course suspicionless boardings inspections whether inland customs waters reasonable therefore violate fourth amendment strong evidence reasonableness authorized first congress course proposed bill rights states continuously authorized statute ever since first simply adequate alternative way enforcing documentation laws documentation laws serve many vital functions primary method identifying vessels serve regulate entry departure persons goods traveling water used collecting import tonnage duties conserving natural resources promoting safe shipping boating honor case certainly moot sides retain legally cognizable interests outcome case decision reversed respondent convictions reinstated government able seek extradition may arrested imprisoned ever found united states minimum reversal decision provide grounds exclusion government indictment dismissed merely purpose complying court appeals mandate think court decisions establish ministerial acts sort could honor might preferable procedure merely technical matter nt think honor believe reversal decision would permit reinstatement indictment convictions therefore think reinstate convictions sentence ever found correct think would happen dismissal indictment purely technical matter would certainly justice stevens must confess nt know happens technical matter indictment conviction reinstated think well see reason indictment reinstated certainly indictment improperly dismissed may reinstated decision reversed nt know whether done state facts afraid ca nt certainly believe correct believe done wo nt dispute fact probably preferable alternative nt think fact nt know justice brennan think done comply court appeals mandate time final decision seek review court made believe reversed remanded instructions take proceedings consistent decision since principal evidence trial evidence suppressed believe think correct otherwise would seek stay every case stay denied every stay case denied would go court stay granted case would become moot yes district court dismissed indictment nt know whose motion know object certainly ca nt move object defense motion well know record nt know certainly correct case sort convictions founded upon discovery contraband suppression contraband necessarily means longer assume justice white reviewed looking docket sheets clear party moved dismissal indictment respondent argument mootness based dismissal indictment based fact respondents deported reason believe dismissal nt think say dismissal indictment merely technical matter done comply court appeals mandate requirement dismissing indictment legal sense would meant outstanding indictment would called trial within certain amount time speedy trial act could retrial fact could unless decision suppressing evidence reversed stayed compliance court appeals mandate practical matter would necessitated dismissal indictment well right justice stevens position making stay motion necessary preserve live controversy well nt authority proposition respondent contention point dismissal indictment mooted case argument deportation mooted case well minimum hope make authority justice white certainly correct mister mr chief justice practical matter suppression evidence meant dismissal indictment court interested well believe certain point motion dismiss indictment ca nt name one offhand would happy brief issue well saying critical evidence suppressed case remanded district court indictment dismissed new trial impractical happened sure court appeals understood going happen decided case believe cases would permit reinstatement complaint believe done truly comply mandate appellate court reversing well practical effect appellate ruling make proceedings trial court impossible think thank saying two reasons suspicionless boardings document inspections necessary first certainly raised question whether reasonable suspicion required argued petition rehearing argued points initially trial merely argued reasonable suspicion present two good reasons first district court found reasonable suspicion believed correct still believe correct second important prior binding fifth circuit cases holding reasonable suspicion needed boarding inland waters therefore saw need urge affirmance district court decision ground prior decisions binding panel ought reversed panel rendered decision raised issue whether reasonable suspicion needed petition rehearing adequate means enforcing documentation laws besides suspicionless boardings addition long history pervasive federal regulation aspects maritime activity persons aboard vessels within jurisdiction united states greatly reduced expectation privacy especially respect vessel documents let first fit within classic border exception believe necessary effectively police sea border sea border nothing imaginary line three miles coast suspicionless boarding document check allowed reasonable suspicion believe vessel crossed border impossible standard unless customs officer actually observes vessel crossing border usually way detecting whether border crossing taken place well believe foreign persons foreign vessel within united states waters legitimate expectation privacy least respect documents honor hesitate analogize closely border searches land sea simply like land well correct airplane usually detect radar whether fact crossed border scheduled airlines know advance coming way gathering analogous information concerning vessel one reasons suspicionless boardings inspections necessary vessel enters us us waters really way knowing coming carrying whether complied well foreign vessel course would foreign would foreign documents vessel country documentation system frenchregistered vessel bearing swiss markings nt know soon entered customs waters required report arrival promptly customs go would need cruising license else would make entry entered customs waters looking basic foreign registry documents registered sort vessel correct federal statute authorizes inspection documents think may vary country country federally documented vessels pieces paper usually kept bridge numbered american boat small certificate number sometimes well think often usually impractical without boarding boat boats rock back forth hit well may perhaps may perhaps part well nt know response would specific case part well think would reasonable first inspect documents well part documentation inspection examining main beam number necessitates visit portion hold required make satisfactory identification vessel believe part standard procedure checking documentation foreign vessel otherwise reliable way knowing sort vessel statute nineteen usc usc fifteen eightyone would entail authority examine documents check main beam number authorizes statute regulations says search vessel says conveys broad power statute reproduced appendix brief page one absolutely correct true foreign vessel entering port would suppose someone attempting set record smallest vessel make transatlantic crossing would subject entry requirements correct vessel like henry morgan ii ii legitimate expectation privacy us us waters vessel like customs expressly authorized statute put someone board leave long vessel us us waters saying inspection vessel documents vitally important performing important national functions simply way effectively enforcing documentation laws markings vessels attempted show brief simply satisfactory easily falsified revealing especially case foreign vessel even case american vessel disclose much respondents suggested number alternatives want stress none would satisfactory certainly hailing vessel suggest substitute looking documents requires customs officers take word persons board checking documents case reasonable suspicion border crossing tried show also acceptable satisfactory check documentation office radio number reasons including fact information available office severely limited well correct issue issue search boarding document check particular case involved large seagoing foreign vessel would nt necessary address applications certainly asserting authority would apply instances customs enforcement responsibilities think yes could customs responsibility would believe authority would extend navigable waters united states customs enforcement authority goes beyond policing entry goods coming abroad although perhaps highly visible responsibility also duty enforce shipping navigation laws would justify boarding many miles inland one case want stress course situation issue let explain briefly suspicionless boardings inspections vessels entail much lesser intrusion upon protected privacy interests land inspections sometimes compared first documentation check made vessel detained briefly inspecting boarding officer search whole vessel searches documents makes visit hold look main beam number appropriate based type vessel nt search cargo cabins passenger compartments one one bases authority primary exclusive basis saying well specifically making argument think also important recognize rule would draw distinction commercial noncommercial vessels would extremely unworkable nt involved case arguing much broader rule case involved vessel located said relatively short distance coast think necessity suspicionless boardings document checks important area statute authorizes boardings inspections areas prepared say extent goes necessary statute unconstitutional right forty foot foreign vessel want stress located far coast although masquerading pleasure vessel fact engaged lucrative although illegal trade carrying seven million dollar million cargo pleasure vessel rule tried draw distinction pleasure vessels commercial vessels would subject sort abuse people engaged violations documentation laws would use sort vessels commonly employed recreational purposes would document recreational use invasion privacy involved stopping vessel conducting document check significantly different involved conducting discretionary vehicle stop land first probably important vessels simply play central role lives average person passenger car suspect people court today used passenger car morning use one tonight doubt many people used vessel use one later day land vessels historically subject close regulation excuse land vehicles subject close supervision vessels fact early statutes customs authority derives specifically required probable cause reasonable suspicion searches land sum important interests served documentation laws judgment far outweigh minimal intrusion upon privacy interests reason customs longstanding authority conduct suspicionless boardings inspections sustained thank two brief points mister mr chief justice first court wishes submit supplemental brief issue whether dismissal indictment mooted case second want emphasize yes honor look well honor said done interest pursuing case done wanted comply mandate court appeals thank sorry point would like add mister mr chief justice crux case documentation inspection conducted possible know sort vessel customs dealing necessary illustrated graphically particular case henry morgan ii ii documented boat basilea louisiana mississippi alaska would exactly markings customs patrol louisiana ship channel came across boat bore outward markings landlocked country five thousand miles away hailing port written latin although vessel bore swiss markings actually french registry situations like come time necessary conduct documentation check determine whether procedures including fullscale border search appropriate believe necessary inspect documents believe statute constitutional provides think case pardon issue conducted document check correct document check conducted reasonable necessary enforcing many important national laws thank part united states customs waters search could made one hundred miles coast coast guard pursuant different statute authorizes boardings high seas vessel subject us us jurisdiction purpose many cases pending issue authority generally upheld courts appeals based upon reasoning analogous arguments advanced case quite number authority sustained least three four circuits cert denied numerous occasions petition rehearing initially settled fifth circuit authority alternative grounds district court raised petition rehearing
