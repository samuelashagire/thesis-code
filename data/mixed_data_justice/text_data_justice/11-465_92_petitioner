exactly honor exactly honor yes honor situation would one presumption regularity two court said richter could view summary denial third underlies written opinion ignored court said castillo said court chooses ignore opinion read opinion writing means claim impliedly rejected therefore state court chooses write opinion mean nt consider reject claim sure honor reason plain statement long held order rebut presumption regularity need clear evidence really clear evidence one could would plain statement court reinforced said richter talked indication state procedural bars cited harris v harris v exactly honor broader rule presumption honor really say affirmed end decision really adds nothing stamp would merely reflexive therefore would end give indication whether argument considered capital

amendment well justice kennedy situation voir dire comes trying get trial judge feeling get rid juror holdout juror voir dire determines juror biased bias makes different honor certainly bias comes saying disagreement really believe felony murder rule therefore evidence whatever evidence presented would able convict disagreed basis law biased juror said court comes voir dire jurors using reasonable doubt standard using doubt standard absolute doubt standard following law biased becomes biased juror right jury well honor believe situation one judge presented possible misconduct therefore something judge done nothing could possibly situation california law examination intrusive maintain degree finding biased juror point time sixth amendment required juror removed saying least type situation court discusses alleged error adjudication merits plays larger broader rule yes especially going look state courts must decide federal state questions interpretation claim necessarily mean eventually becomes federal habeas federal habeas courts limited jurisdiction federal law theories federal petitioner bring claims reason good fit state courts limit way saying least situation state court grappled substance error adjudicated claim could viewed sort single claim independent could state law theories federal law theories puts together would like reserve remainder time thank would like make four points first friend discussed case smith v think would like point court words used smith v court later said castille talking implicit rejection really way interpreted state court fails mention opinion writing implicitly rejected ignored secondly like agree yes california believes ten eightynine constitutional sixth amendment fact ninth circuit miller v third would like agree justice sotomayor trial court made finding bias answered sixth amendment question entire argument throughout disagreement whether juror biased harboring doubts sufficiency evidence counterarguments trial court making determination bias necessarily answered question secondly point would like also point court language people v twentyone p p three could nt order good cause california could nt gotten rid views evidence finally like say mister mr chief justice correct would increase litigation would courts federal habeas courts time trying decide whether sufficient indication deciding whether state law coterminous federal law already seen california following issuance decision exactly type arguments getting time reason court adopt rule fairly presented claim rejected state court
