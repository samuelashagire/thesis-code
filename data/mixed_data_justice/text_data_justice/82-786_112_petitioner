mister mr chief justice may please court case concerns application fifth amendment privilege compelled selfincrimination subpoena issued standard business records sole proprietorship federal grand jury newark new jersey investigating corruption awarding county municipal contracts grand jury issued five subpoenas records standard business records sole proprietorships operated respondent documents included records general ledgers bank statements telephone toll records vouchers invoices words wholly business records sort records kept virtually every business matter size form organization respondent argued act producing records would tend incriminate government offered exchange receiving records use act production way subsequent criminal case government never made offer statutory immunity number least two principal reasons justice oconnor first lower courts case rejected concept act production immunity district court held even immunity given evidence could used way respondent criminal trial would nevertheless inevitably incriminated eyes grand jury well justice oconnor position nonstatutory constructive act production immunity offered case sufficient also believe statutory immunity would available act production would also sufficient area court make clear deciding case statutory immunity would obviate fifth amendment objection think would serious objection holding believe fisher act producing documents would amount testimonial selfincrimination one submissions justice white interested never interested act production therefore quite happy give respondent immunity use interest using act production evidence evidence interested materials interested issue act production helps us get materials well respectfully disagree think nt believe necessary reach issue well certainly claim colorable claim nt believe nt withdraw submission court wishes reach reaching issue immunity well nt believe statutory immunity example offered necessary fully adjudicate legitimacy fifth amendment claim immunity conferred would suppose fifth amendment claim believe essentially happens submission think lower courts found colorable claim immunity issue could reached first absolutely objection court reaching issue selfincrimination means act production first firmly believe selfincriminating reasons fisher think existence possession existence possession standard business records testimonial pose real substantial danger selfincrimination case sole proprietorships true case corporations partnerships certainly special circumstances could claimant privilege make appear judge circumstances present well would submit incorrect yes draw clear distinction submission think crystal clear cases practical concern witnesses solely contents documents abstractly possible think talking standard business records kind records every company seldom case act production amount testimonial selfincrimination subpoenas appendix petition original form redacted petition think possible certain cases question case owns companies case first argued district court respondent came said companies sole proprietorships government district court accepted purposes argument issue owns companies control records yes well believe could easily authenticated numerous means would authenticate way trial would sufficient authenticate would would necessarily sufficient admission exception hearsay rule nt believe think point authentication substantial barrier modern law admission standard business records essentially fiction argue unprivileged contents records blocked grand jury access unprivileged contents blocked based upon largely academic argument act production would amount tacit authentication would result selfincrimination sole proprietorship well attempted justice stevens ask statutory district judge felt immunity offer insufficient believed incrimination eyes grand jury sufficient invoke fifth amendment privilege disagree reason disagreed entire concept court make clear could remand would entirely satisfied believe nonstatutory immunity appropriate special circumstances act production court make clear statutory immunity would obviate respondent fifth amendment claims would wholly satisfactory us think certainly logic position well offer statutory immunity offer large measure unclear either courts would construed offer statutory immunity limited act production courts felt serious problems concept act production immunity retrospect justice marshall might might easier nt think correct justice marshall sure understand question true well perhaps making act producing certain documents certain situations may well incriminating position think essentially said concurrence fisher said existence corporate records doubt therefore conceding existence possession records testimonial must true partnership records light bellis would argue would true standard business records sole proprietorship simply rational basis drawing distinction forms business units ground foregone conclusion corporations general ledgers example equally foregone conclusion would submit sole proprietorship document logic position means case subpoena standard business records regardless form company involved act production would amount testimonial immunity would amount testimonial selfincrimination honoring subpoena witness vouching accuracy contents documents simply saying documents question whether possession documents suppose act production would incriminating case standard business records foregone conclusion company records nt think amounts testimonial selfincrimination event point intended press morning point want make clear would like court address person respondent position basis asserting fifth amendment claim based act production act production immunity tendered argument selfevident certainly hope well many lower courts difficulty problem case court appeals held contents documents privileged principal thing want reversed right generallaughter question contents whether contents records privileged really asking court nothing follow reasoning holding fisher fifth amendment court held applies witness compelled make testimonial communication incriminating court made clear fisher document voluntarily prepared subpoena issued obviously one compels production document subpoena later issued document may compel witness turn document compel witness restate reaffirm contents document therefore contents document distinct act production constitute compelled testimony fall outside privilege would quickly add undoubtedly certain highly personal documents diary perhaps best example may well protected provisions law fourth amendment first amendment fifth amendment privilege selfincrimination applies witness compelled make testimonial communication incriminating court appeals respondent attempted distinguish fisher two grounds authorship ownership papers think neither distinctions make sense either fisher reasoning protection privacy rationale taken boyd fisher course matters whether documents voluntarily created created owned fisher expressly rejected idea authorship distinguishing factor idea ownership sufficient basis claiming privilege earlier rejected couch court wrote tie privilege selfincrimination concept ownership would draw meaningless line would make privilege turn fine distinctions property law even protection privacy rationale taken boyd ideas authorship ownership nt make sense person may well far greater privacy interest document write one write letter written relative close friend may far private witness cancelled check wrote pay last month gas bill believe certain highly private documents might well protected provisions law fifth amendment insofar boyd stands proposition private papers voluntarily created protected fifth amendment would nothing left rule tried argue brief never rule boyd first place thing true authorship true ownership one necessarily greater privacy interest something one owns something else diary belonging relative close friend may far private document relatively trivial nature belonging witness even fifth amendment privilege protect private papers justice brennan argued concurrence fisher abundantly clear documents case private papers papers wholly business nonpersonal nature papers respondent kept private papers exposed persons various times think justice stevens fourteen fourteen appendix last sentence first partial paragraph top page appendix petition gould one prior cases gould stands proposition individual business papers well personal records subpoenaed grand jury footnote discuss nt think true justice stevens continuing discuss holding johansen case held contents office diary protected privilege extend well held contents privileged would argue wrong hold think certainly clear us well think unclear certainly respondent believes held contents privileged event position contents privileged issue remaining whether offer act production immunity sufficient believe nonstatutory act production immunity adequate believe position finds support murphy versus waterfront commission held testimony given state grant immunity may used jurisdiction including federal court means effect state courts empowered give nonstatutory federal use immunity federal statute confers upon authority state statute would think could give authority compelled witness objection testify testimony thereafter automatically immunized think would appropriate federal courts limited area act production immunity government motion courts would order witnesses produce documents objection act production would incriminating act production thereafter would immunized would essentially takes place state courts grant immunity statutes procedures nt serious objections following statutory procedure nt think necessary think nonstatutory procedure convenient since subpoenas documents everyday occurrence unlike requests testimonial immunity think executive authority seek admission relevant evidence nt think anything immunity statute rules nonstatutory act production immunity think think two reasons long string statutes immunity actual testimony one first started enacted beginning think eighteen sixtythree questions answered immunity still unanswered scope immunity circumstances witness required claim fifth amendment privilege forth statutes attempt address questions course took long time sort answers reason case immunity testimony least procedures almost invariably built statute worked protect government serious taint problems arise immunity given testimony statutes require nt see nt think uncertainty state court orders testify state immunity would serious objection case done upon motion equally control whether request nonstatutory immunity statutory immunity case like goldsbury versus convoy last term immunity court asked give immunity without government participation asked question well district court judges generally require attorney general appear person point justice white purely matter internal management justice department event would submit prediction judge orders witness testify fifth amendment objection think settled think said clearly anyone else manness versus meyers testimony thereafter may used fact term functional immunity taken concurring opinion manness versus meyers felt third circuit precedent especially statutory immunity necessary said ca nt make clear think important question principle act production immunity court make clear sufficient case like would wholly satisfactory would like reserve rest time two brief points first emphasize case asking enforcement subpoenas subpoenas quashed court vacate decision otherwise make clear would free remand grant statutory immunity interests would substantially served second point point clarification pressing argument nonstatutory immunity case immunity testimony limited area act production immunity think argument incriminating nature act production essentially academic serious taint problems order district court quashed subpoenas court appeals affirmed case moot asking anyone held contempt suppose attempting say asking judgment vacated judgment merely quashed subpoenas nt enforce yes saying made clear remand grant statutory immunity would obviate fifth amendment objections would satisfy position although continue maintain limited area act production immunity nonstatutory functional immunity would sufficient enter order vacating quashing subpoenas well understanding would equivalent would still procedures would followed subpoenas enforced well making alternative arguments justice marshall believe believe offer nonstatutory immunity satisfactory court disagrees makes clear offer statutory immunity would sufficed would would serve interests correct witness would ordered comply presume refused comply might held contempt never occurred well would gone district court asked order enforcement yes absolutely correct absolutely nt intend grant immunity one principal issues yes thank
