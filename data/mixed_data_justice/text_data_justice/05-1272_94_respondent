also isolated references theory trial characterize theory liability think would misconception government nt persuade jury one way pondcrete failed statute nt require direct independent knowledge fraud requires direct independent knowledge information allegations based basis making prediction believed process would malfunction also aware think independent whether every public disclosure would open rockwell argue response original complaint stone could nt consistent rule eleven make allegations happened plant left longer evidentiary basis rockwell could made argument regardless whether public disclosure occurred question whether permissible inference plaintiff say saw committing systematic environmental violations inferred thing would go left question permissible inference plaintiff federal civil action make question decided federal rules civil procedure public disclosure provision serves different purpose entirely designed cases relator sufficient information file complaint complies federal rules similar procedure information overlaps substantially information public domain knowledge think also important recognize original complaint focused pondcrete specifically original complaint alleged generally rockwell engaged widespread environmental safety health violations consistently misrepresenting government compliance even though knew guess would would disagree premise reasons nothing whatever government getting money return hypothetical suggested earlier government filed connected allegations certainly look theory liability prevailed trial namely pondcrete blocks leaking hazardous substances environment rockwell nevertheless asking government funds based misrepresentations compliance look theory liability examine stone original complaint clearly theory logically encompassed within generalized think would put hypothetical offered government adding claim rockwell misrepresented compliance antidiscrimination laws think wo nt clear dividing line think line courts draw purposes well think would think could still sufficient connection even reason thinking pondcrete failed turned correct would emphasize particularly reason pondcrete failure element claim mean imagine case tried jury established rule place pondcrete shown failed defect machinery stone would get share shown failed human operator added little cement stone would nt get share rule would clear potential disharmony government relator would raised exactly specter justice ginsburg alluded government prefers emphasize one view facts rather another defendant getting way suggesting relator deprived share well think mean need know hypothetical initial reaction complaint easily dismissed based rule eleven leaving aside question public disclosure imagine extreme hypotheticals think complaint gets line evidence relator possession barely good enough sustain allegation fraud least allow suit go forward reason read public disclosure think would still want compare nature fraud government alleged nature fraud relator alleged obviously question court going balance competing interests possible come hypotheticals seems though relator equitable entitlement share two things want emphasize first terms way lawsuit progresses even government nt intervene relators file suit allowed proceed presumably take advantage rules civil procedure include discovery provisions federal rules would obviously selfdefeating tell relator invoke discovery learn relevant information defendant nt know already ca nt use trial use something nt direct independent knowledge complaint filed turns persuasive jury kicked original source nt think congress said intention second cases government relator intervenes government intervenes relator suit two prosecute suit together would want court avoid rule would create artificial disincentives cooperation two plaintiffs idea relatively minor variations factual assertions ultimately necessary establishment false claims act liability carried day relators future circumstances would strong disincentive accede government request one view evidence emphasized rather another court nothing questions minor variation sense relevant defendant ultimate liability proved pondcrete leaked hazardous substances environment rockwell knew effect nevertheless represented government compliance would enough establish knowing submission false claim even idea reason pondcrete failure even rockwell taken herculean measures produce good pondcrete departed standards care respect nevertheless knew pondcrete fact failing despite best efforts represented succeeding would liable false claims act mean instinct would probably could still recover think question would boil whether discovery responses public disclosures would trigger new original source mean probably question would raise public disclosure issue begin least public disclosure fraudulent conduct revealed discovery would need satisfy original source test respect new allegations
