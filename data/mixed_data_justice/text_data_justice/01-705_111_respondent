statute congress could really intended limit authority commissioner make assignments act nothing implausible even unusual reading statute mean says consequence assigning particular miner statutory deadline miner unassigned statute statute tells us unassigned miners elaborate backup provision solicitor general calls deal unassigned beneficiaries first foremost receive benefits assigned miners certainly first congress point view overriding purpose continue benefits taken care second coal miners get benefits whether assigned unassigned argument undermines pay principle pay principle embodies rough justice company employs miner two years pays benefits another company may employed twentyfive years compromise agreed fine nt mean pay principle unqualified desideratum assume congress intended pursue costs perpetuity know case deadline yes know example purpose wanted pursue ueber alles company goes bankrupt one purposes yes one congress said spend year trying make assignments got launch fund really going commissioner wants different sort job congress delegated sort project think critical distinction deadlines pierce county sorts cases agency could done reasonably good job project four months better job year maybe nearly perfect job five years congress said want one year version want one year version nearly perfect version miners going get benefits either way coal companies funds established coal companies going pay either way yes question right assignments congress congress knew congress knew unfairness requiring companies pay unassigned beneficiaries cushioned unfairness saying going draw aml aml fund coal operators established earlier date ensured unassigned preexisting fund established based believe perton royalties point everybody contributing different amounts get third stage unassigned beneficiaries premium assessed yes done pro rata peabody coal example sizeable bill reaches four thousand assigned miners case three thirty miners assigned october first point whether could write funding mechanism equitable fair question whether one congress wrote well well like regulatory statutes first extraordinary grant authority impose retroactive liability grant exists nowhere sentence says shall think quite different saying epa epa two years issue clean air regulations different case pierce county quite different think government probably inherent authority recover misspent funds harm harm comes disregarding kind deadline said sort project spend twenty years always come perfect assignment congress knew knew significant amount work involved go set interim funding system february october give commissioner time commissioner came back said done completed oh oh sure well concern court noted last term sigmon coal case coal industry characterized significant amount transactions mergers acquisitions could looking acquiring coal company course given nature industry first question ask liability going say well much merger acquisition takes place get another notice know forty new miners sudden much significant concern sigmon coal significant instance nt think interest significant factor way interest rates time period certainly nt much cushion unfairness inequity getting bill retroactive much five interest apparently charged key factor transactions play particular industry may well explain nt see companies side case think always wise skeptical fairness arguments raised proxy companies complaining oh going end potentially paying higher pro rata assessment otherwise number reasons congress cushioned unfairness recognized making aml aml fund available second statute suffused concepts rough justice necessarily perfect result pursue five years instead one year pay principle necessarily lead perfect result may mean companies employed miners two years paying benefits companies companies employed miner twenty years nt pay yes think helps us course express provision assignment october first provisions reassignment provisions yes aware situation reassigned someone never assignments right point although provision oh means october first saying case reassignment say go back reassign applicable percentage based assignments particular company october first specific exception allows reassignments exception reassignments would point provision allows changes case unassigned miner going primarily commissioner revisiting unassigned pool quite different lot deadline cases think commissioner get job done time wants different yes yes part one thing congress told know coming deadline nt change deadline kept place look solicitor june believe asked february made june early july well think commissioner get work done time wants perfect job saying reasonable congress determine nt need perfect job need goodenough job job good enough get fund launched one thing clear way petitioners read statute proposed coal act enacted never would gotten ground idea giving commissioner significant discretion openended timetable certainly cards legislative equivalent trench warfare parties fighting every inch black lung model give secretary labor significant discretion allocating responsibility consequence coal mining wanted nothing think know primarily statement like think know structure statute carefully reticulated delegation discretion commissioner compromises statute spelled talk revisiting fairness keep mind looking one particular provision say well looks unfair may another provision issue balances court noted sigmon instance legislative horse trading log rolling setting system everybody pitch older pension funds pitched operators pitched congress came forward aml aml fund moved forward place october first wheels would fallen deadline sort got one twenty days issue decision thank honor
