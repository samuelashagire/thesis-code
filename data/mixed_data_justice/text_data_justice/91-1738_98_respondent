attack case brought instructions victorious honor reasonable attorneys reasonable individuals make oversights make mistakes case chairman committee late colleague professor hadad within one year promulgation rules writing law review articles say made grievous mistake made mistake look instructions nt tell jury consider defense murder concededly relevant first time claim made illinois court federal courts federal courts know honor know district honor understanding believe right honor believe typical methodology courts illinois use pattern instructions unless challenged think question nt defense counsel challenge difficult question nt know whether uphill battle involved challenging within years twenty years years short years challenged challenged every court agreed case like case honor court sustained instructions claim state bear burden negating defense claim speaking speaking honor courts see points presented courts engage restraint pass issues presented fact court past realized example penry v jurek held okay case simply part pattern part culture ignored attacked within years immediately courts state federal said uhuh problematic absolutely take away right present
