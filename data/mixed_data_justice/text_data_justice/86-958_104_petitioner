balance rights remedies bargaining mix congress established enacting nineteen seventyeight bankruptcy code unfairly expands socalled cram power debtors severe detriment creditors first point think clearest language statute honor difficulty position substantial attraction bright line test suggested solicitor general brief would avoid difficulty valuing new contributions former owners reviewing legislative history absolute priority provisions bankruptcy code frankly certain whether congress intended totally abrogate prior rule los angeles lumber would say appear least specific intent overrule prior case law however appear reviewing legislative history clearly intention part congress way expand whatever exception might absolute priority cases think contrary true seen fact defining term fair equitable absolute priority rule evolved judicial decisions congress chose expressly define fair equitable exclude retention property without full payment senior creditors bankruptcy code went much favor debtors several cases point fact key point honor tulsa revision bankruptcy laws proposed bankruptcy commission recognition special difficulties individual debtors recognition maybe rule los angeles lumber court harsh commission suggested laws amended relax absolute priority rule general allow equity participation former owners particular allow participation individuals period time plan congress enacting nineteen seventyeight code expressly follow recommendations commission instead congress enact specific provisions eleven twentynine b absolute priority rule codified statute something harsh ring indeed language terms absolute commenting would like observe perceive least real world bankruptcy work way nineteen seventyeight bankruptcy code order confirm plan reorganization debtor need invariably satisfy absolute priority rule case earlier case law case v nineteen seventyeight bankruptcy code debtor needs overcome absolute priority rule convince creditors fare better reorganization debtor retains interest would liquidation part mix bargaining rights believe established congress code rare situation debtor either unable unwilling make satisfactory offer creditors issue cram comes play veto power absolute priority rule comes play briefs submitted respondents amicus curiae supporters seems argument made absolute priority provisions bankruptcy code somehow make distinction individual debtors corporate debtors appropriate apply absolute priority rule prevent shareholders corporation retaining equity interest somehow appropriate apply rule debtor individual think response argument twofold first plain language absolute priority rule statute admit distinction individual corporate debtors throughout bankruptcy code clear congress chosen deal particular needs particular classes debtors done example individuals exempt certain property estate section five twentytwo individuals avoid liens exempt property section individuals entitled complete discharge debt section seven twentyseven farmers immune involuntary bankruptcy cases section oh three addition congress made special provisions individuals farmers chapters twelve thirteen think implication fairly clear congress chosen absolute priority rule could indeed specifically suggested bankruptcy commission enacted congress decision looks around think clear language statute seeks rely court decision case v respect think ruling case v fact los angeles lumber case reversed decisions lower courts allowed equity owners retention equity interests bankruptcy consideration retention future management standing community like close think court appeals done case case v court appeals respondents amicus supporters strive fit sweat equity notion within apparent exception case v argument goes debtor case agree provide services future equivalent new capital operation therefore violation absolute priority rule allow debtor retain interest property several problems first would apply virtually chapter eleven case involving individual debtor obviously implicit individual reorganization individual intends keep working business next argument made respondents debtor really would retaining anything retained value debtor equity property therefore valueless therefore retention problem analysis obviously going concern value parties would litigating last three years value theory read attorney general amicus brief endorsed rejected professor nimmer article rely exception star city rebuilders case believe value argument rejected every lower court consider next argument make agreeing provide future services debtor injecting new value organization would enable effect purchase property objection creditors problem argument promise provide future services really nothing new implicit original loan time take loan business implicit promise repay going work business generate funds repay happening situation debtor seeking level debt structured bankruptcy saying okay going promise repay lower debt working business precisely original promise implied context nothing new secondly point notion debtor services providing consideration buying assets substantial part involves bootstrapping return use property going come debtor use land equipment cash collateral subject creditor claims portion whatever funds could generated solely attributable debtor services therefore new value finally exception angeles lumber speaking allowing equity holders buy capital infusion clearly capital infusion must money money worth difficulty lower court decision ahlers unenforceable promise provide future services current asset los angeles lumber item put balance sheet business organization present value liquidation purposes short enhance estate creditors plan fails promise debtor work future give creditors unpaid rights would therefore believe totally illusory obligation finally think broader context difficulty ahlers overall context bankruptcy code severely upsets relative bargaining positions debtor one hand creditors gives strong tool debtors virtually ever case involving individual reorganization far departure least believe congress mind real upshot ahlers contrary provisions bankruptcy code contemplated secured creditor able criteria met obtain decision lift stay motion within thirty days making motion stay lifted creditor would receive protection interest duration bankruptcy case turned upside ahlers decision seen case petitioners started secured creditors hold dual roles precluded three years enforcing rights collateral probably declining interim confronted ahlers upheld seeing debts restructured decision lower level proceeding longer period continuing risk ride debtor policy arguments one argue might appropriate approach attempting assist troubled farm economy response precisely congress done attempted enacting chapter twelve bankruptcy code responses problems perceived invariably legislative responses rather calling changing dramatically provisions chapter eleven bankruptcy code think congress chapter twelve various state legislatures farm mediation acts like demonstrated ability address problem believe effort court appeals judicial means inappropriate would like reserve balance time may thank mister mr chief justice agree mister mr needler ahlers decision sweeping ramifications substantial ramifications eighth circuit lesser degree elsewhere among problems lower court decision ahlers limited limitable perceived problems agriculture rather equally applicable chapter eleven reorganization proceeding

unsecured creditor creditors control group unsecured creditors amount number absolute right vote absolute priority rule terms absolute law close one hundred years changed congress nineteen seventyeight anything strengthened tradeoff however rule although absolute new law waived creditors therefore incumbent debtor convince creditors fare better plan reorganization leaves property hands management debtor would liquidation case liquidation would produce zero unsecured creditors debtor convince creditors get something voting favor plan goes class honor believe two thirds dollars majority number within class agreement reached reorganization go forward without need pay one hundred cents dollar absolute priority rule exists protection creditors either offered anything value debtor confidence debtor ability perform whatever promises made purpose rule congress change tightened ahlers case came along subject serious question thank
