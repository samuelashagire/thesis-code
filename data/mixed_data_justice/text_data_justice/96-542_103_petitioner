particular area head division decides move another part birmingham mobile nothing status function jurisdiction limits yes nt know could moved sense someone assign authority prosecute cases counties direction court authority sometimes sort prosecutors conflict another local prosecutor another jurisdiction defendant victim particular case sense think properly seen state officials might able exercise legal authority area elected judicial circuit judicial circuit bigger county everyone judicial circuit would voting well think different way justice scalia may exceptions exigencies might give sheriff opportunity conduct conduct recognized exceptions recognized ways giving permission sheriff exceed lawful authority think fair criticism think less exceptional matter practice matter law prosecutor engage kind conduct place else think point emphasized next thing stress alabama law requires another elected county official take law enforcement functions sheriff perform county coroner alabama law assumes law enforcement functions circumstances times sheriff ca nt think state law recognizes county county residents investment stake authority least selection limited circumstance performing law enforcement functions particular community things would point would many references alabama law clearly designate sheriff county official cited brief cite acknowledge alabama code brief page twentyone expressly identifies county officers sheriff alabama sheriff particular county constitution justice breyer identify member executive department nt dispute look language however constitution says sheriff member executive department words use sheriff county well think alabama law conflict question particular question part alabama courts clearly said want immunize state counties tort judgments kind conduct nt think though obviously going resolve federal question court always acknowledged right justice breyer conflict tort liability state county regard nt federal question require court impose respondeat superior liability accept view recognize sheriff county official engages law enforcement authority county sense master superior one control way someone else control asking make party liable alabama counties done shield counties states liability something state law position federal section nineteen eightythree intended provide federal remedies people like petitioner right mister mr chief justice position respect position sheriff county official exercise final policymaking authority county county controls sheriff sense elect county funds sheriff sense pay conduct sheriff tied jurisdiction nexus county sheriff make respondeat superior congress talking respondeat superior kind vicarious liability eighteen seventyone dealing sherman amendment trying make counties liable conduct persons riotous tumultuously assembled community liability know everyone anyone sheriff anyone government official elected empowered local government conduct complaining facts circumstances tort purposes correct honor true honor regard whether state law immunities bind court certainly position true court always held federal law decided way state may choose limit

resolve issue regents court court decision eleventh amendment context contexts always made clear federal law resolves kinds questions think consistent congress trying get certainly congress intend eighteen seventyone provide federal remedy state courts decide constitutional officers county officials involved kind conduct shielded federal remedies designating something county officials rest code identifies justice breyer conflict term term tort law per se provisions alabama code clearly designate sheriff county officer supreme court state court held county sheriff county official contexts question pension employment county official question discretion county commission make payments law enforcement functions sheriff county official legal authority make county commission give resources kind conduct yes county liable coroner conduct aware state law deals tax assessor context yes would resist framing liability respondeat superior view tax assessor coroner different parts power structure county government like mayor city council aldermen right body nt understanding would basically city liable conduct one officials use terminology yes sense city person represented official context official well guess would city officials making policy city way creates liability city think fair statement correct honor regard state law correct county engage kind relationship exists county commission think concede authority make policy would create liability county relationship county commission county entity right county city ca nt go arrest somebody subject someone kind conduct client subjected think congress intended make localities liable treasury locality liable well think two things justice scalia think imagining structure corporation imagine board county commission sheriff tax assessor coroner sense asking anything different would traditional context corporate structure four elements county commission dealing one part sheriff dealing another part coroner tax assessor well think well second thing say congress passed law made clear talking bodies politic corporate embrace kinds jurisdictions power separated power directed various officials mean ways would think sort exceeding court authority impose municipalities single view governance single view meaning single corporate body makes policy decisions order municipality govern mean alabama chosen divide powers ways provide sheriff functions county commission functions tax assessor coroner functions nt think federal law would require change well guess position would also make political bodies status power engage kind unconstitutional conduct empower someone kind unconstitutional conduct took place make municipalities liable conduct tom tate individual could subjected client threats summary execution suppressed evidence resulted wrongful conviction six years death row crime nt commit could power given voters monroe county yes think court decision pembaur precisely situation court found county sheriff district attorney final policymaking authority area search seizure arrest county could held liable conduct variety contexts court done novel notion hold entity local legislative body final policymaker create policy makes binds municipality county liable unconstitutional conduct particularly ability dependent power authority status resources provided municipality mean tom tate individual could done petitioner without resources without funds without power given county circumstances view know federal remedy ought turn personal sovereignty individual wrongdoer correct way authority county officials resources provided county commission sense relationship county distinguish county commission county body politic respect county commissioners relationship county different sheriff county commission creates policy unconstitutional control questions would exist access questions county treasury would exist difference functionally relationship county commission county sheriff county true justice scalia right final policymaker area certainly policies policy would subject someone racial threats assaults policy would remove county jail well mean whole range legitimate policies might procedure arresting people charged dui dui requires either yes correct correct absolutely justice souter meaningful control sheriff sheriff engaged conduct reelected county election says something county approval conduct certainly believe nineteen eightythree ought play role deterring correct absolutely absolutely power like correct justice scalia like well well think removal power regulated every four years every four years opportunity exercise removal discretion like reserve rest time rebuttal like least suggest court accept notion sheriff state policymaker law provided two provisions point sheriff state identity constitutional provision contend label best ambiguous label says sheriff county state tort law judgments contend relevant rest alabama law repeatedly refers sheriff county officer eleventh circuit hold sheriff makes policy state precisely justice stevens suggests kind difficult notion like department public safety employees subject state hierarchical command respondent tries say removal authority somehow state exercises control removal authority alabama applicable county municipal state officials remove mayor county commissioner city commissioner sense help us resolve question third thing identified brief pages twentythree twentyfour state law enforcement provisions identify state law enforcement officers provisions sheriff never referenced never included think gives good evidence sheriff state policymaker finally going accept election funding status county official governing rationale county commission county official either relationship county also dependent three factors elected paid identified county officials nothing else alabama law makes county representative sheriff respects think appropriate necessary hold county liable resources empower somebody like sheriff engage kind unconstitutional conduct petitioner could happened resources mister mr mcmillian would spent six years death row unless county gave sheriff power arrest stop withhold evidence things violated rights circumstances certainly position federal remedy ought turn personal sovereignty wrongdoer ought turn wrongdoer conduct made possible solely wrongdoer initiative conduct unless questions rest
