thank mister mr chief justice may please court justice scalia nt want emphasize yes well think could fact graham court makes statements trying exempt shield juveniles kill quote intend kill language could basis organizing court thinking issue obviously case nt requirement specific intent kill required alabama case might dictate certain different outcome think challenge juvenile status juvenile intent much complicated issue many reasons problematic kids function first stage trials would hard right think yes hear think question justice sotomayor would justification crimes intent kill court jurisprudence recognized kind hierarchy outlined exhibited enmund court cases true arkansas provision adult would still subject death penalty used recklessness language even focus intent kill addressed enmund might categorically protect juveniles think court rightly acknowledge diminished culpability also worth noting many states children sentenced life without parole confusion convicted homicide offenses intent kill dispute jurisdictions provisions would likely addressed enmund analysis well would absolutely right felony murder little different arkansas cooperate give aid someone commits crime even intentional reckless indifference life found guilty capital felony murder arkansas court interpreted mean adult subject death penalty kuntrell jackson subject life without parole state argues support even kind intent dispute words quickly know three yes correct exactly right exactly right exactly right dissenters arkansas supreme court relied making determination conclude intent established way would support judgment seek goes back one earlier questions posed happens guilt phase justice kennedy true alabama jurisdictions would permitted tell jury sentencing outcome would many cases nt lesser included going prosecution crimes range offenses would help jury kind deal kind choice would really depend justice alito facts example one provisions alabama makes crime sort homicide capital crime victim age fourteen entitled diminished culpability kind homicide charge unless something else going would support laws court law say evidence support lesser included instruction court constitutionally obligated provide reason given would happen think challenge mandatory scheme talking cases put sentencer difficult situation ability consider age ability consider factual diminished culpability might exist one case ability either cases consider fact older codefendant got lesser sentence something else going goes beyond particulars crime particular offender culpability reckless indifference life gave aid assistance someone capacity question justice breyer turned statement made codefendant testified kuntrell jackson initially told police came said ai nt playing testified said thought yall playing well yes state argued fact knowledge gun went made guilty reckless indifference even though nt create kind intent kill typically require kinds showings significance around language come say something declaratory suggests directed victim might help kind support intent finding nt yes court correct justice breyer think court knows precedents recall tison followed enmund tison v would would categorically prohibit matter intent think particularly children age think case highlights meant thought playing versus ai nt playing nt good indicator whether someone subject life without parole think evidence yes yes think evidence would support finding aggravated murder would obviously stronger even court points roper decisionmaking children thinking children categorically different thinking three steps ahead thinking consequences actually experienced enough world understand deal frustrations way adult judgments intend declarations mean something different one factors nt talked want emphasize inherent internal attributes also external circumstances find kuntrell jackson born household nothing violence guns people shooting grandmother shot uncle mother shot neighbor brother shot someone put jail unlike adult children nt ability escape child fourteen leave criminogenic violent environment control think reinforce even judgments socalled intentional judgments reflect different kind understanding character potential rehabilitation would adult yes think first true homicide offenses less common nonhomicidic offenses graham court looked range nonhomicide crimes huge number three hundred thousand largely talking multitude offenses talking single offense think fact seven thousand children arrested homicide nonnegligent murder manslaughter forty year time period seventynine children sentenced life without parole significant fact reinforces claim rare sentence one percent fact forty years also true seventynine got right well absolutely right justice alito first point arrest data course used graham cohort conviction data simply difficult get true children arrested aggravated murder subject life without parole mentioned states create largest population kids kinds homicide subject life without parole true states yes extent get convicted murder states south dakota pennsylvania come mind whether first degree second degree subject life imprisonment without parole mandatory sentence states true yes nt think well ca nt get beyond data tell us want suggest less precise court deal graham graham talked three hundred eighty thousand nonhomicide offenders half class people convicted drug crimes one suggested would subject life without parole another sixty thousand convicted assaults kids get fights time used aggregate numbers made comparison actually argue dealing category definition much precise dealt graham justice kagan return question precedence help us coker v court noted nine ten jury made decisions life versus death chose life talking death rate ten percent larger universe talking rate one percent yeah think two nonrandom arguments made two ages start young age fourteen consider fact thirteen jurisdictions thought one set age fourteen think rely make determination minimum age fourteen think also consistent court precedents look frequency sentence population states never sentenced child life without parole crime fourteen never done thirtytwo states children fourteen younger serving life without parole think allows court nonrandom way defend judgment also think nonrandom argument made draw line eighteen offenders age eighteen exactly court done roper court done graham relied juvenile status applicable poll concede indicia quite compelling right yeah guess point justice breyer think right indicia complicated want stress less meaningful mandatory sentences nt tell thing contexts also think true recognized age eighteen juvenile status coherent court recognized cases think defensible true developed child fourteen child ten also true adult make distinction lots ways well yes court thompson made distinction offenders age fifteen fifteen younger older offenders twenty years law country could subject younger offenders death penalty ways could older offenders clearly precedent appended also lots statutes mean also make kinds distinctions mean draw lines frequently range areas dealing constitutional questions dealing kind complete analysis justice kagan comparisons point reference thompson court also struggling question frequency rarity court actually look number juveniles sentenced death age sixteen death row compared number people death row time noted point three six percent population people death row thing sentencing project reports fortyone thousand people united states serving sentences life imprisonment without parole compare number seventynine actually lower proportion people serving life without parole court found constitutionally significant thompson think thompson coker reinforce saying exceedingly rare sentence majority states never chose impose would provide basis court conclude cruel unusual nt intend justice ginsburg think think distinction question stronger argument traditional measures lower culpability kuntrell jackson case found specifically intended kill state alabama could subject life without parole states would subject based degree culpability guess point even challenge court wants engage kind thinking children intend children complicated question different question nt mean concede irrelevant question think court absolutely conclude diminished culpability jackson case evident based facts crime actually dissenter jackson case made observation consequences crime course many nonhomicide crimes kind fortuities sometimes prevent death wonderfully grateful problem differences children adults internal attributes deficits judgment crime specific person intends kill nt actually better judgment character maturity impulse control person nt way characterizing rule would recognize create categorical ban questions reserve rest time rebuttal points justice kennedy want kind remark literature commutation arkansas actually quite common nineteen eighty case colleague referenced prior date since uncommon one commutation since two thousand seven current governor nonhomicide offense also want say kind consistent earlier argument court strike mandatory death sentences woodson v think way court could certainly final point really say suggesting states able impose harsh punishments severe sentences even children commit kinds violent crimes position state arkansas state alabama parole boards place even impose sentences give authority maintain control lives children rest natural lives arguing hope release would incompatible child status rule roper logic roper graham could argued every person worst thing ever done policymaker decisionmaker might consider constructing kind sentences impose kind regime create totally legislatures court said children uniquely worst act quintessentially children way constitution requires respect child status argument simple argument would unusual recognize virtually every area law crime committed simply abandon simply ignore roper graham teach us ca nt consistently eighth amendment prohibitions reason unusual judgment would cruel declare children fit die prison given know status development potential reasons would ask court reverse lower court judgments grant relief case jackson v
