rough estimate found offending benefit state gave retirees approximately dollar twelve million year comes dollar five per taxpayer per year pardon honor never asked refund asked one hundred percent refund despite fact refund ten times amount offending benefit despite fact small percentage two point five million fund vast majority honor nt think discrimination based federal government decided davis asking roughly ten times amount found offending benefit given funded two hundred thousand people funded entire taxpaying public corporate taxpayers amici rough estimate based honor fact many fewer many fewer state retirees virginia virginia state retirees sixty thousand federal retirees two hundred thousand record also differential example nineteen eightytwo average federal retiree virginia got dollar fifteen thousand income average state retiree got less dollar five thousand asking one hundred percent tax exemption certainly intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine never entitled exemption personal harm really redressed well honor suggesting federal interest advanced really amounts taking two point five million taxpayers massive amount would otherwise state assets
