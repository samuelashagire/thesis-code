thank mister mr chief justice may please court case district columbia court appeals court held respondent trial first degree murder jury must never know voluntarily confessed crime receiving miranda warnings expressly waiving rights five months confessing invoked right counsel arrested unrelated drug charge charge resolved guilty plea three months questioned murder decision court appeals reversed facts dispute respondent arrested drug charge read miranda rights book invoked right counsel police immediately stopped proceedings respondent provided attorney two months later pled guilty lesser drug charge part plea bargain three months still custody arrested murder charge unrelated drug offense read miranda rights time chose waive giving police videotaped statement confessed role murder lower courts reluctantly suppressed confession even though found voluntary found respondent waiver knowing intelligent thought result compelled court decision edwards arizona rule suspect invokes right counsel police may reinitiate questioning suspect statements presumed involuntary honor think would barred roberson first argument well first line basic submission morning guilty plea dramatic change circumstances justifies lifting presumption court never occasion consider whether edwards presumption continues face guilty verdict let alone guilty plea edwards roberson minnick subject position invoked right counsel police reinitiated questioning pretrial suspect however meantime respondent found guilty matter led arrest triggered miranda rights first place counsel course entering guilty plea consulted attorney yes course police well nt even say course respect drug charge sixth amendment would prevent police interrogating respondent drug charge using sentencing issue question would whether invocation fifth amendment right seems us invocation respected police immediately stopped proceedings change circumstances like entry guilty plea reasor presume suspect wishes continue saying police free rein question presume willing talk police without attorney situation changed sufficiently well nt know reasoning may thought suspects often giving statement custody may thought giving statement would exculpate direct police another direction statement exact opposite effect tantamount confession point matter originally arrested originally triggered miranda rights resolved investigative process use material enhancing sentence drug charge drug charge sixth amendment right counsel attaches issue fifth amendment right counsel whether edwards presumption continue effect guilty plea investigative process difference investigative process drug charge course miranda centrally concerned police unlikely continue investigation sentencing attorney questioned drug charge sentencing drug charge nt apply sixth amendment right dramatically different invoked right counsel suspect drug charge police reapproached longer suspect convict found guilty reasonable assume dramatic change circumstances might alter judgment whether talk police without lawyer would sixth amendment protects right counsel custodial interrogation respect drug charge court explained mcneil nt apply murder charge think lawyer nt present proceeding would become stage drug proceeding nt think could used sixth amendment right well guilty pleas treated elsewhere example federal rules evidence guilty plea still subject appeal example may still used impeachment purposes cases also held although specifically addressed federal rules sentencing still pending guilty plea guilty plea may used impeachment purposes honor nt think brightness line absolutely paramount factors guilty nt think goes far dichotomy clear edwards rule proposal today think false one court applies edwards today looks circumstances case look see individual custody look see done amounts invocation right counsel look see whether waived invocation subsequent initiation look see whether police interrogation although court nt decided yet think look see make sure continuously custody suggesting additional relevant factors consider factors look concerns ones court already considers look determine reasonable end edwards presumption extent bright line needed guilty verdict course bright line beyond sentencing would another bright line guilty verdict significant addressed concerns trigger miranda miranda concerned investigative process end defendant found guilty well nt think honor sentencing nt directed concern miranda investigation suspect invokes right counsel presumably afraid without counsel say something incriminating found guilty well miranda applies coercive pressures custodial interrogation sixth amendment indicated protects police questioning information use sentencing probation officer something like certainly split whether sixth amendment applies even nt position custodial interrogation miranda edwards would nt apply event respect need bright line position first guilty plea bright line line needs brightness commend consequence excluding voluntary warned confession circumstances case probation officer prosecutor office well would assuming sixth amendment right probation process issue courts split yes nt regard probation procedure custodial interrogation miranda nt triggered neither course would edwards brightness line view consideration need look court indicated purpose rule serving prophylactic rule created imposed court must justified reference purpose purpose edwards roberson minnick prevent police badgering plausible basis concern case suspect questioned police five months invoked right counsel police promptly respected right counsel invoked approached different offense consulted attorney implausible suppose suspect reaction police come back going wish would stop badgering purpose yes honor position approach different offense sufficient dissipate concern edwards based upon purpose prevent police badgering protect ease administration bright line aspect prophylactic rule edwards created court protect another prophylactic rule miranda turn designed protect fifth amendment violation fifth amendment confession found lower courts voluntary violation miranda familiar warnings given found lower courts knowingly intelligently waived concern police badgering concern led edwards first place circumstances think protecting ease administration second level prophylactic rule insufficient justification keep voluntary warned confession yes certainly could think could ask drug charge circumstances well break custody would lift think jail think sufficient passage time yes first thing say yes first thing say course think presumption longer justified purpose basis imposition prophylactic rule court imposed edwards course quite different case second approach five months later next morning concerned entirely unrelated offense offense meantime suspect opportunity permitted consult attorney fact police officers came back second time suspect said nt want talk told facts similar case therefore think yes presumption continue indefinitely yes two months enough one month enough two days probably enough nt bright line well line looks first reiterate principal submission finding guilt brightness paramount concern trumps even keeping voluntary warned confession well guilty plea finding guilt course sharp bright line principal submission also think combination factors roberson minnick opportunity consult attorney approach entirely unrelated offense also sufficient lift edwards presumption also bright line beyond think time relevant factor whether suspect custody critical factor consider applying edwards honor indicated prior opinion slippery concept bright line whether suspect invoked right counsel miranda right sixth amendment right bright line court experienced cases well nt know never cited provision course face purports overturn court decision miranda yes well well nt rely case position rely upon ca nt explain nt repeatedly cited perhaps concern well aware ever say nt relied case therefore relying aware taken position statute overrule need miranda warnings aware relied point well think case sure cases like arguing confession admitted believe consistent miranda cases believe one need take would ultimate fallback position nt matter violated miranda statute says miranda longer good law well yes course open court decide basis since relied relying reason think important limitation edwards presumption extend indefinitely future imposes serious impediment upon law enforcement people custody valuable investigative resource police often committed crimes often information committed crimes question posed edwards police officer question individual custody people arrive custody circuitous routes unusual defendant arrested california detained questioned transferred new york detained questioned different authorities transferred illinois await trial still different charges police officer illinois may know nothing individual custody may information offense investigating officer officer supposedly clear guidance edwards find individual ever invoked right counsel anytime anyplace authorities whether continuously custody since time whether time initiated contact police thereby waived previous invocation answers questions nt follow prisoner around card may state officials california bail officer illinois fbi fbi new york reason important clear guidance police think rule provides clear guidance people oftentimes valuable information crimes submission today would put reasonable parameter officer ask finds defendant pled guilty found guilty officer nt need go back beyond little miniinvestigation must conduct even approaching individual keep mind first thing officer says approaches tell us murder right attorney present answering questions one thing suspect respondent position knows experience reminded second administration rights right respected case different edwards allowed consult attorney also different roberson three days went allowed consult attorney also different minnick although allowed consult attorney second approach concerned offense short period time three days elapsed edwards suspect told talk police refused cases edwards roberson minnick real concern court concluded suspect would reasonably think miranda rights given real police keep coming back suspect invokes rights could decide nt mean say various rights plausible concern facts case questions like reserve remainder time thank honor think important remember exactly suggesting today finding guilt think particular guilty plea police may presume suspect willing talk without attorney saying facts changed extent reasonable regard question open question first thing suspect reminded right talk police without attorney still given change situation still wish talk police without attorney say worked last time knows work words deck reshuffled dealt new hand reason presume opening bid going think finding guilt guilty plea sufficient change circumstances justifies reopening question respect difference guilty plea sentencing sixth amendment interrogated information used sentencing drug charge custodial interrogation questioning court official warnings given edwards presumption nt apply first place think guilty plea guilty verdict rather sentencing determining factor officer court yes aware split among lower courts whether sixth amendment right applies probation officer interview course ca nt used sentencing understanding yes probation officer give miranda warnings submit required custodial interrogation questions thank honor
