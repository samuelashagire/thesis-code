thank mister mr chief justice may please court requirement claimant exhaust administrative remedies proposition espouse particular issues raised appeals council ordinarily deemed waived technically distinct serve similar purposes requirements reflect recognition judicial review federal agency action imposes significant costs executive branch federal courts costs imposed unless clearly necessary particular courts intrude upon agency processes agency chance take best shot solving problem internally nt think accurate characterization agency practice think perhaps helpful court look regulatory provision discussed appendix page one yellow brief petitioner reply cfr cfr cite twenty cfr cfr four oh four point nine seven oh regulation says says cases appeals council review appeals council review case lists various criteria correspond pretty closely normal standards appellate review judicial review agency action think interpretation regulation best clarified contrasting court certiorari practice often said supreme court court error happens frequently would imagine cases brought court certiorari petitions even though majority justices perhaps even justices believe case incorrectly

majority people represented represented attorneys order decide case court need decide nothing attorney representing claimant well think part perhaps suggested question justice scalia asked something perhaps improper inherently problematic agency promulgating regulation purports tell district courts supposed conduct review agency well think right agencies perhaps precise regulations request administrative appeal supposed look like point none regulations cited petitioner regulation aware purports describe consequences judicial review could done regulation pointed brief opposition agency current intention court holds entitled invoke administrative default principles would revise forms provided claimant representatives order alert prospect issues nt doubt could done well think think ten minutes ministerial act actually filling form writing words clearly would nt encompass stage reading assimilating alj alj decision deciding whether appeal worth taking deciding issues raised think couple points would make question agency could stated potential consequences clearly think questions court first administrative default rule good rule going forward second good rule going forward equitable basis applying rule case think accurate say appeals council within time constraints substantial look beyond particular claims error well theoretically appeals council look record extent time permits think limitation issues regulation addressed specifically class cases appeals council grants review requests submissions parties much court might grant certiorari guess best indication would every regulation reprinted look code federal regulations view sequentially comes regulation deals circumstances appeals council grant review review correct guess would disagree suggestion duty imposed

claimants final determination would made court whether claims raised appeals council would waived social security administration would simply making clear view would conducive fair operation system could return point second representation attorney would make sense claimant hire attorney agree pay portion recovery attorney accept representation agreement supposition appeals council perform precisely mode review matter content challenge whole point well really precisely point fact social security administration typically go beyond claims raised request review look parts record determine

scheme certainly claimant believed appeals council would provide precisely mode review regardless content request correct claimant would incentive retain lawyer think incentive people understand way system operates even though appeals council look beyond four corners request review still much likely act favorably request review precisely identifies purported errors past fiscal year granted review approximately twentyfour percent cases around two percent outright reversal award benefits twentytwo percent cases remanded alj alj give idea significance figure total number cases wholly partially favorable decision issued twenty thousand cases number new ssi ssi disability insurance cases filed federal district court equivalent period little thirteen thousand cases still mean think correct saying fact defending proposition indicates agency concluded whole benefits rule outweigh may instances cause filing overlong requests review appeals council whole think claimants precisely identified weaknesses alj alj decision agency mission guess couple different permutations one would claim alj alj opinion reflected erroneous legal premise alj alj opinion primary claim made alj alj opinion ignored much documentary evidence submitted without good reason claim nature could nt presented alj alj nt know alj alj issues ruling weight attached particular evidence correct point trying make probably social security cases cases generally turn questions assessment evidence less questions abstract principles law absolutely correct would true appeals council well appeals council policymaking body duty apply established ssa ssa policy individual cases claim instance regulation violative statute statute violative constitution could nt presented either alj alj appeals council great deal written although bulk cases really court appeal cases seen applied rule claims raised agency thereafter deemed waived simply ignored dismissed claim raised presumably good reason raising claim agency court would consider merits nt good reason raising court typically would nt remand agency give second shot mean think certainly entirely appropriate court entertain question good reason raising agency think question would answered negative top everything else claimant represented counsel published opinion within fifth circuit eighteen months previously said clearest possible language issues raised appeals council absent extraordinary circumstances ca nt raised court think perhaps reason petitioner nt attempt argue court appeals yes would ordinarily waiver principle inapplicable good cause rather petitioner argued properly overruled certainly nt nt think could reasonably overruled ground lack notice thought inconsistent mean made argument much like petitioner inconsistent manner appeals correct think correct inevitable cost default rules context whether administrative default default issues issues raised district court waived appeal habeas lot situations particular cases inquiry whether particular claim fact preserved may complicated inquiry merits agree possible outcome think argue administrative default cases purpose get individual claim kicked court hope principles become established claimants representatives realize order preserve claims judicial review must raised agency appeals council given better opportunity fix mistakes way avoids definitely agency committed revising form pending determination court obviously court held agency entitled invoke administrative default principles notice notice would nt advising claimants administrative default rule might apply court holds permissible rule social security cases agency committed revising form order form would sent think partly order avoid claims kicked unnecessarily perhaps better answer would agency well courts benefit claims made clear appeals council appeals council given best possible opportunity fix mistakes reason wait court started machinery printing hundreds thousands new forms said nt raise claims may barred court court three months later came decision said find sort rule fundamentally inconsistent nature appeals council therefore impermissible questions notice one side agency obviously could nt advise claimants might subject consequence court said would nt subject believe lawyers lawyers think correct certain category cases appeals council remand case alj alj explanation
