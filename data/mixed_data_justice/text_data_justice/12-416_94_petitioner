mister mr chief justice may please court general matter payment one business another exchange recipient agreement compete paradigmatic antitrust trust violation question presented whether payment treated lawful encompassed within settlement patent infringement suit answer question reverse payments settle hatchwaxman suits objectionable reasons payments compete generally objectionable subvert competitive process giving generic manufacturers incentive accept share rival monopoly profits substitute actual competition mean really two differences scenario one presented first exclusive license expressly authorized patent act section two sixtyone title thirtyfive second thing second thing exclusive license nt give infringement defendant anything could nt hope achieve prevailing lawsuit least right compete would nt get prevailing lawsuit infringement defendant would able sell wherever wanted may point point money given substitute earning profits competitive marketplace hatchwaxman settlement context definition disagreement parties relative merits infringement invalidity questions patent infringement suit brand name saying patent valid infringed generic saying either patent invalid conduct wo nt infringing generic wins able enter market immediately brand name wins able keep generic patent expires circumstance logical subject compromise would agree upon entry date two end points parties damages action would expected settle case defendant agreeing pay portion money would pay lost actual subject compromise nt problem yes yes adopt respondent conception means act within scope patent let explain respondents say restrictions issue within scope patent mean goods restricted arguably encompassed patent restriction nt extend past date patent expires mean exclusive test defendants masonite new wrinkle inline material would hook cases involved restrictions trade patented goods period patent effect yet court found antitrust liability way respondent tries explain masonite example masonite involved resale price maintenance agreement patentholder sold goods attempted control price would resold court said rule patent exhaustion patentholder nt right therefore patent laws provided shield agreement held violation antitrust laws respondents say well consistent theory restriction imposed went beyond scope patent right control resale one rights patent act confers test whether restriction within scope patent would say met nothing patent act says pay competitor engage conduct believe infringing really thrust position patentholder nonsham allegation particular mode competition would infringement patent patentholder pay competitor engage competition talking conduct judicial determination infringement occurred talking cases patentholder nonsham allegation infringement would occur well ftc ftc consistently taken position department justice two thousand nine nt endorse scope patent test indeed invitation brief joblove specifically said scopeofthepatent test nt provide enough scrutiny settlements advocated department justice advocated instead test would focus strength scope patent likelihood brand name would ultimately prevailed suit litigated judgment two thousand nine first time amicus brief filed second circuit took essentially position taking agreements sort treated presumptively unlawful presumption able rebutted various ways would say way well test whether payment would tend skew parties choice entry date would tend provide incentive parties generic agree entry date later one would otherwise insist probably case test would greater practical import cases parties perceive patent well think kind settlement would regard legitimate parties simply agree compromise date generic entry parties would certainly take account assessment would likely happen end suit parties believe brand name likely prevail brand name agreed early generic entry would presumably fairly small amount time conversely parties collectively believe generic brand name weak case generic likely prevail would negotiate earlier date problem reverse payment gives generic incentive accept something competition means earning money mean take another suits types payments appear essentially unknown lawsuits patent infringement cases congress tried reduce incentives payments made well couple things would say first nt think asking overturn established antitrust laws take along analogy example watson instead developing generic equivalent androgel developed entirely new drug believed would better androgel conditions solvay paid watson seek fda fda approval seek market drug think everyone would agree per se antitrust violation even though watson ultimate ability market new drug would depend fda fda approval might might granted say unlawful buy uncertain competition unlawful buy competition even competition might prevented means enforcing standard antitrust principles focus distinction hatchwaxman patent litigation professor hovenkamp conclusion reason nt see payments like normal patent infringement suit typical market patentholder known paid large sum money competitor making challenge patent competitors knew happened would perceive sign patent weak would leap says hatchwaxman makes difficult done hatchwaxman gives unique incentives first paragraph four filer one eighty day period exclusivity yes way works exclusivity period good consumers period one generic market others yet allowed compete essentially duopoly conditions price drug drops little bit congress granted one eighty day exclusivity period wanted generics ample incentives challenge patents perceived weak first filer able essentially bought able set settle something early entry marketplace potential competitors face barriers entry similarly situated competitors would nt face industries well court recognized thing quick look approach think even though case nt use term quick look nt believe ncaa ncaa v well one familiar need look back see think would leave courts without guidance without guidance factors would appropriate well certainly proposed approach accounts provides provides really two different forms rebuttal first approach says face agreement compete generic agreed stay market defined period time payment gives rise inference agree delay generic agreed longer period would otherwise reflect best assessment likelihood success lawsuit say basically two different types ways presumption could rebutted first parties show payment consideration delay commensurate value transferred payment arrangement would entered even without larger settlement second least accepting possibility brand names generics could come say even though payment delay even though ca nt identify anything else payment could consideration still quote competitive let say couple things administrative nightmare first extent inquiries difficult difficult brand names generics made difficult tacking additional transactions settlement proposal take analogy government ethics rules say called prohibited sources basically people business department ca nt give gifts government employee obviously would absurd rule said prohibited source could nt give rolex watch could sell rolex watch dollar ethics rules treat gift exchange value fair market value paid everybody understands go route occasionally hard cases people could legitimately agree legitimate arm length exchange concealed gift prospect difficult cases nt mean get rid gift ban altogether certainly federal employees could nt bring ethics office knees engaging proliferation side deals ethics office decided worth second thing respondent approach would apply even hard questions respondents would say even agreement provides delayed generic entry date patent expires even term agreement brand name pays generic lot money would legitimate agreement restriction would apply arguably patented drugs would nt extend beyond date patent expiration guess thing would say way payments facilitate settlement really shows anticompetitive potential suppose parties negotiating compromise date entry could nt agree brand name said beginning two thousand seventeen earliest let generic said beginning two thousand fifteen latest date would accept respondents use term bridge gap obviously way payment brand name generic could enable parties agree entry date two thousand fifteen two thousand seventeen brand name never going say well would insist holding two thousand seventeen going pay whole lot money let earlier accept diminution profits brand name going say pay money going insist deferring entry even later two thousand seventeen date would otherwise preferred compromise natural effect payments facilitate bridging gap sense picking point dates parties would otherwise insist going likely cause parties agree entry date even later one brand name would otherwise find acceptable price fixing agreement compete parties agreeing prices charge generic agreeing stay market first would treated per se wanted tweak theory way say cases payment agreement date market entry additional consideration exchanged beside wanted say plaintiff would bear burden showing fair exchange value something would agree would fairly minor tweak theory rule mean bad reasons administrability bad conceptually reason bad reasons administrability least take proposing antitrust court would consider factors might bear assessment agreement would include presumably strength patent claim subjective atypical mean court ncaa ncaa example said agreement looking dealt allocation allocation rights televised football games essentially limitation output court said presumptively unlawful long experience market shown suspect court nt say long experience market television rights football said output limitations established disfavored nevertheless competitive sports nature require degree cooperation people compete establish rules game forth look see whether parties identified whether defendants identified anything specific industry would justify decision apply usual presumption concluded nothing really asking court take approach saying payments compete generally disfavored parties hatchwaxman settlement money passing brand name generic unusual settlement begin way suit could culminated generic receiving money judgment therefore look upon suspicion give parties adequate opportunities rebut may like reserve balance time thank mister mr weinberger argued order determine whether settlement sort anticompetitive effects would know lawsuit would turned perhaps fundamental principle antitrust law particular conduct legal illegal depending deliberative process led put concrete terms business charges particular price particular product made assessment maximize profits competitive environment decision almost immune antitrust scrutiny business charges price product market agreed competitor charge price per se antitrust violation anomalous say type agreement deemed anticompetitive even though result namely exclusion generic market might able obtained means second thing mister mr weinberger said instances second successive filers attempt challenge brand name even first filer bought think disagree easy would say concede happens occasionally fact particular anticompetitive conduct nt always work nt make lawful could often happen two firms thinking entering pricefixing agreement instance thought third competitor market able undersell us would make agreement unprofitable might happen sometimes two firms try proceed pricefixing conspiracy thwarted unexpected competition third firm mean first certainly evidence suggesting happened often although evidence happened brand name perceived systemic basis likely result paying one competitor another competitor would step could nt bought would litigate suit judgment would incentive make reverse payment first place making reverse payment brand name attempting purchase protection possibility patent invalidated suffer large competitive advantage brand name thinks particular instance somebody else going expose risk payment would nt expected made least think reasons question suggested one eighty day exclusivity period leaving aside cases waived subsequent manufacturers would realize would nt get period heightened profits would wait line others might focus attention patents perceived weak could hope get one eighty day exclusivity contract know great majority nt percentage figure reason indicated earlier one eighty day exclusivity period two competitors basically biopoly arrangement understanding generics would usually charge around eighty eightyfive percent brand name price period full competition price would drop fraction next thing would say system encourages settlement nth degree instance two two firms fighting million dollars firm decided internally six hundred thousand least accept stuck guns case could nt settled public could made kick additional two hundred thousand firms could get six hundred thousand walk away content nt pursue policy favor settlement degree essentially happening way payments facilitate settlement inducing generics agree later entry date increasing total pool profits available two firms combined thereby maximizing likelihood firm find share profit satisfactory last thing would say think everyone comes issue recognized conundrum natural instinct compare settlement expected outcome litigation everyone also recognizes nt feasible try patent suit therefore approach focuses whether competitive process preserved
