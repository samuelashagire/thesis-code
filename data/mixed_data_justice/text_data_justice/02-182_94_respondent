discussed retrogression standard grounded word abridge explained word abridge necessarily implies comparison baseline section two context baseline hypothetical reasonable world section five targeted specifically voting changes appropriate baseline jurisdiction existing practice think likelihood mean think think well think one one thing court focus talking senate districts issue talking districts among strongest blacks state georgia benchmark plan thirteen fiftysix districts senate districts within state majority black voting age populations state approximately twentyseven percent black terms voting age population say districts blacks strongest reduced point blacks equal opportunity elect candidates equivalent saying state whole blacks equal electoral mean think going ninety percent certainty fiftyone percent likelihood would still say retrogression sort substantiality inquiry department justice preclearance practice think part part reason government challenged three districts magnitude increase part also electoral history evidence racially polarized voting nt nt know reason nt object senate district fifteen know senate district two instance even though bvap bvap benchmark plan sixty percent nineteen ninetynine runoff election black candidate choice primary seventy votes reason black candidate received approximately seventyeight percent black vote nine percent white

court acknowledged principle even though black voters ability elect candidates choice three districts substantially decreased state might nevertheless able prove nonretrogression plan whole presented evidence would offsetting gains districts court faulted state failure proof nt suggest analytical barrier proceeding along basis think district court regarded relatively easy case precisely meaningful losses identified districts attempt prove offsetting gains others retrogression standard always focused whether change renders minority voters worse preclearance inquiry would substantially substantially complicated analysis otherwise court held instance relocation polling places one type change precleared gravamen testimony would offsetting gains black voters ability elect candidates choice really thrust plan black voters would taken majority black districts placed districts predominantly white black percentages would low black electorate elect candidates choice might high enough black vote could swing balance white republican white democratic candidate really thrust plan whatever might said first instance court analysis focused ability elect candidates choice congress amended section two facilitate vote dilution claims along lines congress continued reenact section five backdrop court decision even though argument could made important blacks balance power lot districts
