mister mr chief justice may please court case squarely controlled court opinions graham v fact tennard penry claim based completely unexplained iq iq score much weaker graham johnson two reasons first tennard claim governed aedpa aedpa requires deference texas court reasoning opinion second tennard disembodied iq iq score really minimal mitigating aggravating significance within special issues honor believe given proper consideration whether considered apart question justice kennedy however case take look counsel strategy whole defending case basically decided paint tennard less culpable party among codefendants paint follower illustrating allowed prior rape victim escape questioning role murders case strategy counsel certainly nt believe nt think record iq iq score independent mitigating significance beyond follower theory nt object instructions special issues given nt attempt argue outside context everything placed jury idea tennard follower case made less culpable fact mitigating within context future dangerousness court reasoned jurek said duress domination codefendants would cognizable within special issue counsel presented argument evidence effect tennard model prisoner incarcerated prior prior rape conviction disciplinary infractions clearly counsel global theory kind diminished capacity commit offense justice scalia would say fifth circuit really looking whether state court opinion reasonable case state court apply penry way try determine applied johnson graham tried determine whether evidence relevant within special issues given defined believe justice oconnor one proper interpretation developed screening test sorts try engender sort consistency many many many penry claims would one argument would advance justice oconnor sort screening prima facie analysis penry claim designed handle wide variety types evidence offered know low iq iq nt know whether jury aware fact time trial never explained honor never contrasted iq iq score however think fifth circuit opinion illustrative difference fourpart test identified fifth circuit determining penry violations additional analysis goes top even aside question whether nexus whether whether severity permanence factors court invariably ends looking whether jury could consider evidence within special issues whether relevant way meaningful way question court identified johnson graham controlling factor penry cases think think eighth amendment requires looking johnson graham jury able give effect manner evidence introduced able required give effect every conceivable way issue nt really whether tennard identify relevance evidence beyond special issues given whether whether look record see relevance within special issues available jury think exactly state court case looked deliberateness tennard argued brief think quite eloquently deliberateness truly designed deal question party liability whether defendant reasonable expectation death would occur case party instruction given guilt innocence phase lingering question whether tennard primary actor exactly tennard counsel argued jury suggested tennard follower nt primary may even stabbed victim case might codefendant may lying minimizing responsibility order cover tracks theory jury counsel perspective fits squarely within deliberateness justice souter question admissibility though court looking appeal honor combination question looking whether evidence mitigating significance whether significance beyond scope special issues think honor may true disagree honor think think uniquely severe permanent handicap test identified fifth circuit en banc opinion graham basically description penry evidence question honor fifth circuit test even issue case issue companion case smith looking denial coa coa context aedpa aedpa whether state court treatment issue reasonable think quite honor state court taken slightly different tack address nexus severity uniquely severe test addressed tennard evidence case ex parte tennard contained joint appendix apply test past taken different approaches nexus example state court always held nexus established automatically defendant introduces evidence mental retardation granted relief numerous cases point several cases brief pages twentyseven twentyeight identified think six seven state court granted relief saying know mental retardation uniquely severe described penry earlier cases affects defendant ability control impulses affects ability learn mistakes things mitigating automatic nexus difference way fifth circuit applied way state court applied nt honor state court initially began asking identifying less four factors whether whether evidence involuntary disability whether permanent nature whether severe enough whether least inference nexus evidence four factors parallel less uniquely severe permanent handicap language graham two tests gone parallel years although state court vindicated many penry claims fifth circuit simply meritorious claims found got relief fifth circuit never faced number cases state court presented evidence rose level think retrospect fifth circuit test becomes little bit severe viewed vacuum compared way state court done basically meritorious claims vindicated yes justice ginsburg correct however nexus requirement applied differently state court fair statement justice souter whether jury could infer connection think brief smith honor justice breyer evidence interesting contrast two cases smith introduced abundant evidence think mitigating effect fact antisocial personality disorder factors tennard iq iq evidence came prison record form sole number sixtyseven parole officer testified identified number admitted cross idea given test idea kind test given given factors laid correct honor recognized iq iq test point nt identified shortform test fullscale iq iq score honor contained social criminal history form introduce page sixtythree joint appendix form parole officer called witness defense brought form nt know answer question either presumably someone would know psychologist administered test would know possible honor except defendant evidence case nt think state necessarily looked significant evidence like nt think defense looked significant evidence justice souter graham johnson trying figure whether evidence relevance within special issues whether every bit relevance whether meaningful relevance think looking weight evidence part analysis look see jury would meaning jury would given correct honor honor believe issue might add threshold requirements questions relevance evidence could fit within special issues looking severity nexus looking evidence mitigate moral culpability tend excuse crime generally speaking justice souter evidence fails pass test relevance within special issues generally speaking tends either show crime aberration looking something trying identify penry error looking evidence solely aggravating answering special issues necessarily evidence relevance outside special issues whether aggravating relevance within relevance within think court talking graham johnson looked youth determined yes youth may significance outside future dangerousness fact significance within future dangerousness cures potential penry error exactly factors fifth circuit identified state court lesser extent designed root try catch types evidence determine whether indeed relevance correct fifth yes honor correct honor case fifth circuit looked state court adjudication well honor contrary mean contrast penry prior cases came court de novo review bound aedpa aedpa looking reasonableness think court necessarily looking different angle whether court simply disagrees test issue really would nt merited honor think court disagrees test applied fifth circuit court still stuck determining whether state court opinion reasonable court could await another case raising issue last count approximately one hundred may still death row texas sentenced sentencing scheme sure claims arrive day case nt think court option applying aedpa aedpa state court opinion think really looking whether fifth circuit whether federal court application aedpa aedpa debatable even one step removed reasonableness sense nt think case generally speaking yes honor trying trying analyze penry claim trying figure whether whether evidence introduced trial significant relevance moral culpability outside scope special issues think combination factors necessarily one one one gets nexus requirement basically asks question whether actually relevance moral culpability whether relevance reaches level placed outside special issues well example justice scalia think evidence follower status example argued extensively jury case would nexus crime course involved circumstances crime therefore would fall within special issue deliberateness jury asked resolve issue specific intent required party situation like well think well would question whether evidence actually relevance moral culpability connection defendant crime think inquiry looking part multipart test fifth circuit state court devised think best explanation occurs fifth circuit opinion robertson v en banc opinion three twentyfive f f three court summed entire body penry jurisprudence identified four factors relevant voluntariness requires nexus least inferential nexus crime honor would evidence would relevance within future dangerousness would go good character good character evidence nt necessarily nexus crime good character evidence relevant within special issues court held jurek rule strict justice souter requires inference causation think child abuse think child abuse truly analogous youth example think average juror understand connection moral culpability youth something people wrong justice souter think child abuse evidence presented case may bigger problem honor difficult topic however nt think absolute honor think may causation argument looking said common knowledge jurors jurors know people abused children turn certain way honor aware cases excluded evidence severe child abuse however cases mild moderate sketchy evidence child abuse used correct honor honor think robertson recent case court took issue child abuse see red light finish answering
