mister mr chief justice may please court case clean water act concerns environmental protection agency authority issue known fundamentally different factors fdf fdf variances effluent limitations standards toxic pollutants let begin briefly describing effluent limitations set important role fdf fdf variances play process effluent limitation simply figure tells facility much particular pollutant permitted discharge usually expressed pounds kilos pollutants per one thousand pounds product example one pound pollutant per one thousand pounds steel plastic whatever separate sets effluent limitations known direct dischargers facilities discharge wastes directly navigable waters indirect dischargers facilities discharge public treatment works case concerns indirect dischargers basic arguments direct indirect discharger contexts direct dischargers required meet two sets effluent limitations nineteen seventyseven required meet effluent limitations associated known bpt bpt best practicable control technology currently available nineteen eightyfour nineteen eightyseven depending type pollutant required satisfy stricter standards known best available technology economically achievable indirect dischargers similar requirements called pretreatment standards effluent limitations set known categorical basis industrial category subcategory epa epa identified categories industry pollution control urgently needed taken larger categories sliced numerous subcategories fairly broad quite narrow fact subcategories included one two facilities clean water act set effluent limitations standards epa epa job using factors generally set act example factors used bat bat pretreatment include age facilities equipment involved energy requirements different types pollution control technology different manufacturing processes may used cost achieving effluent reduction let give example using factor cost may return later argument epa epa may determine particular subcategory new advanced form pollution control technology cost let say threequarters million one million dollars per facility install epa epa may find cost one million dollars per plant economically achievable epa epa may conclude subcategory technology represents bat bat best available technology economically achievable gathering information relevant factors making determinations categories subcategories enormous task indirect discharger category thirty sixty thousand facilities thirtyfour primary industrial categories epa epa supposed go work really breathtaking pace act epa epa given one eighty days proposed pretreatment standards american industry epa epa able meet impossible deadlines result respondent law suits pending agency past decade seeking compel agency move quickly epa epa hope issuing effluent limitations reasonably expeditious basis concentrate typical plants rulemaking phase atypical ones consequently one epa epa problems unusual plants may older may use different manufacturing processes energy costs may different location factor let return example bat bat calculated cost threequarter million million dollars facility one unusual plants cost may two million dollars far beyond economically achievable facilities subcategory epa epa supposed deal problem unusual plant one solution one respondent recommends brief would epa epa simply withhold issuing categorical limitations tracked every single facility every single subcategory category consideration determined requirements factors facility may theoretically possible would certainly delay issuance categorical limitations would serve purposes clean water act yes justice oconnor essentially believe fdf fdf variance mechanism respondent argues precisely correct achieve substance would based concessions perceive respondent brief think issue case boils agency course argues may use fdf fdf variances pollutants respondent says least case toxics take respondent concede epa epa may amend effluent limitations regarding toxic pollutants irrespective language three oh one one argued categorically prohibits anything may termed modification correct take respondent made one part brief argument three oh one one clear face necessary look think fdf fdf revision within meaning three oh seven neither modification within meaning three oh one one concession made respondent want mention concession amendment effluent limitation may appropriately create subcategory one plants put two concessions together take concede epa epa may essentially fdf fdf variance mechanism different procedure think understood dispute case boils agency position surely must prevail agency permitted follow procedure prefers unless congress dictated another procedure understanding testimony house session epa epa mentioned fact third circuit decision case overturned aware whether occurred justice oconnor understanding specific bill containing provision proposed fact amendments clean water act adopted session event whatever congress certainly nt think possible infer intent adopt third circuit decision event congress intends concerning three oh one one poor guide intent congress adopted three oh one one nineteen seventyseven think stems five oh one authorizes agency issue regulations necessary implement act think stems two potentially conflicting statutory commands clean water act namely issue limitations categorical basis based factors vary significantly among seemingly similar plants tension two statutory commands fdf fdf variance mechanism think permissible way reconciling think th dupont case court recognized fdf fdf variance appropriate perhaps even necessary mechanism bpt bpt context see reason draw distinction bpt bpt bat bat pretreatment area statutory authority epa epa practical problem issue defensible categorical regulations reasonably expeditious basis taking account factors may vary greatly plant plant certainly heart submission statutory modifications different fdf fdf variances congress intended three oh one one apply exclusively statutory modifications intend three oh one one apply fdf fdf variances think center third circuit misunderstanding inability understand difference statutory modifications fdf fdf variances fdf fdf variance correct mistake corrects mistake establishes kind effluent limitation set first place statutory modifications something different three oh one c return example bat bat calculated cost threequarters million million dollars plant came said ca nt comply ca nt afford three quarters million dollars would ineligible fdf fdf variance might eligible three oh one c similarly section three oh one g fact epa epa may consider setting technologybase effluent limitations difference statutory modifications fdf fdf variances understood court already clearly recognized difference explained length national crushed stone case one difference understood think becomes apparent congress nineteen seventyseven makes perfect sense congress said believe statutory modifications prohibited toxic pollutants fdf fdf variances available pollutants fdf fdf variance corrects mistake whether mistake toxic pollutant pollutant corrected statutory modification yes epa epa calculated bat bat subcategory three quarters million million dollars plant came said age equipment let us say cost going two million dollars beyond economic capability anybody group economically achievable group plant might eligible fdf fdf variance hand plant came said know calculated cost three quarters million million dollars see accurate ca nt pay even three quarters million dollars go business plant ineligible fdf fdf variance would shown agency consider proper range factors individual plant economically weak could afford compliance think distinction congress drew nineteen seventyseven statutory modifications correct incorrect effluent limitation excuse compliance proper limitation based factors weak economic condition particular plant certain circumstances factors take precedence congress said comes toxic pollutants factors must take backseat distinction congress drew reason think congress limited three oh one one statutory modifications fdf fdf variances fdf fdf variance device epa epa used deal problem unusual worked well allowed agency issue regulations quickly would otherwise possible stop worry every unusual facility country helped agency defend court challenges regulations facilities claiming fundamentally different specifically cited several courts appeal turning away challenges necessary use safety device often speaks think accuracy effluent limitations issue case course meaning three oh one one prohibits modifications effluent limitations toxic pollutants said epa epa position always limited exclusively statutory modifications three oh one c respondent says contrary plain language three oh one one respondent says modification change effluent limitation makes effluent limitation lenient interpretation correct would happen epa epa issued effluent limitation toxic pollutant discovered analysis mistaken circumstances changed energy costs skyrocketed example technology previously economically achievable became unaffordable plain meaning argument epa epa would powerless amend rules ca nt congress intended well think would justice oconnor point provision prohibits modifications permits revisions provisions clear face necessary take account interpretation agency expertise act necessary look legislative history think indeed term art three oh one one congress used modification three oh one one way used modification three oh one c everything legislative history supports evolution three oh one one three oh one one derives senate bill nt anything comparable house bill senate however senate bill separate provision like three oh one one three oh one c conference committee take language three oh one c provide notice colleagues expanding substance provisions provided explanation change suggests us change intended purely stylistic also congress said three oh one one admittedly say much almost every time referred specifically linked three oh one c also inference believe may fairly drawn congress say point legislative history three oh one one member congress suggest three oh one one intended reach epa epa wellestablished wellknown practice granting fdf fdf variances member congress intent believe would said something nobody respondent says congress aware fact epa epa issuing fdf fdf variances incorrect least two reasons first epa epa including fdf fdf variance provisions bpt bpt regulations time think well known environmental community respondent says congress worried bpt bpt nineteen seventyseven put mind bpt bpt going remain effect seven years seems completely implausible variances pertaining pollutants later designated congress toxic way toxic pollutants handled clean water act radically changed nineteen seventyseven nineteen seventyseven believe supposed dealt primarily section three oh seven separate set effluent limitations toxic pollutants nineteen seventyseven decided would dealt primarily regular technologybased effluent limitations issued three oh one effluent limitations issued fdf fdf variances limitations pollutants later designated toxic pollutants pollutants three oh one one applies list included consent degree nrdc nrdc government prior nineteen seventyseven amendments referred section three oh seven act pollutants sixtyfive set provision code federal regulations returning argument respondent maintains congress aware epa epa practice granting fdf fdf variances think thing really refutes argument court decision dupont occurred early nineteen seventyseven clear water act enacted late nineteen seventyseven dupont referred prominently fdf fdf variances pivotal case act think members congress surely congressional staff members concerned clean water act amendments nineteen seventyseven must aware fdf fdf variance mechanism anybody intent restricting epa epa practice granting fdf fdf variances think someone would said something mentioned one also important realize granting fdf fdf variance toxic pollutant completely consistent congress intent nineteen seventyseven take strong measures toxic pollutants said fdf fdf variance correct mistake establishes kind effluent limitation set first place
