would say conflict think meaning phrase inconsistent may little bit different even assume thing think different situation district court made local rule purported govern federal civil actions test enunciated determining whether rules conflict first compliance possible second well first court hanna v correct think inquiry well think question whether particular state rule incorporated federal practice fundamentally different one question whether federal statute passed congress specifically intended regulate filing service complaints federal courts force effect serious thing reach conclusion act congress impliedly repealed serious say state rule primarily intended state court actions incorporated federal practice correct well remember reading one district court case plaintiff
